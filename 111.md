# Oracle manipulation can affect flapper since OSM is not used

## Summary
Oracle manipulation can affect flapper since OSM is not used

## Vulnerability Detail
The [current version](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdbbe5e9b1daa91430cf0772fcebe53f6c6f137df#code) of PIP_MKR is not an implementation of OSM and hence the price is read as is without any delay and also lacks the freezing functionality in case of any malicious update
The flapper contracts uses this price to estimate how much of `gem` should be obtained when it sells `dai` and hence a malicious oracle operator collusion could result in malicious prices which would be used immediately by this contract. This can result in the flapper contract selling dai for very low prices causing a loss to the protocol

## Impact
Malicious oracle operator collusion can cause flapper contract to sell dai at low prices

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement OSM for MKR
