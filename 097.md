# unchecked transfers in the `_mint` and `_burn` functions

pwning_dev

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `_mint` function, the transferFrom method of the nst token is called without checking its return value:
```
function _mint(uint256 assets, uint256 shares, address receiver) internal {
    require(receiver != address(0) && receiver != address(this), "SNst/invalid-address");

    nst.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), assets); // Unchecked transfer

    unchecked {
        balanceOf[receiver] = balanceOf[receiver] + shares;
        totalSupply = totalSupply + shares;
    }

    emit Deposit(msg.sender, receiver, assets, shares);
    emit Transfer(address(0), receiver, shares);
}

```

In the `_burn` function, the transfer method of the nst token is called without checking its return value:

```
function _burn(uint256 assets, uint256 shares, address receiver, address owner) internal {
    uint256 balance = balanceOf[owner];
    require(balance >= shares, "SNst/insufficient-balance");

    if (owner != msg.sender) {
        uint256 allowed = allowance[owner][msg.sender];
        if (allowed != type(uint256).max) {
            require(allowed >= shares, "SNst/insufficient-allowance");

            unchecked {
                allowance[owner][msg.sender] = allowed - shares;
            }
        }
    }

    unchecked {
        balanceOf[owner] = balance - shares;
        totalSupply      = totalSupply - shares;
    }

    nst.transfer(receiver, assets); // Unchecked transfer

    emit Transfer(owner, address(0), shares);
    emit Withdraw(msg.sender, receiver, owner, assets, shares);
}

```
## Impact
### Scenario 1: Transfer Fails During Minting
If the transferFrom call fails during the _mint operation:

- User Impact: The user who initiated the minting will not have their tokens transferred, but the contract will still issue shares. This means the user gets shares without actually providing the underlying tokens.
- Contract Impact: The balanceOf and totalSupply for the shares will increase inaccurately. The contract's perceived holdings of the underlying token will not match the actual token balance.

### Scenario 2: Transfer Fails During Burning
If the transfer call fails during the _burn operation:

- User Impact: The user who initiated the burning will have their shares burned, but the underlying tokens will not be transferred back to them. They effectively lose their shares without receiving the equivalent value in tokens.
- Contract Impact: The `balanceOf` and `totalSupply` for the shares will decrease, but the actual tokens will still be in the contract. This can lead to a build-up of tokens in the contract that do not correspond to any issued shares.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
`_mint` Function with Checked Transfer
```
function _mint(uint256 assets, uint256 shares, address receiver) internal {
    require(receiver != address(0) && receiver != address(this), "SNst/invalid-address");

    bool success = nst.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), assets);
    require(success, "SNst/transferFrom-failed"); // Check the transfer

    unchecked {
        balanceOf[receiver] = balanceOf[receiver] + shares;
        totalSupply = totalSupply + shares;
    }

    emit Deposit(msg.sender, receiver, assets, shares);
    emit Transfer(address(0), receiver, shares);
}
```
`_burn` Function with Checked Transfer

```
function _burn(uint256 assets, uint256 shares, address receiver, address owner) internal {
    uint256 balance = balanceOf[owner];
    require(balance >= shares, "SNst/insufficient-balance");

    if (owner != msg.sender) {
        uint256 allowed = allowance[owner][msg.sender];
        if (allowed != type(uint256).max) {
            require(allowed >= shares, "SNst/insufficient-allowance");

            unchecked {
                allowance[owner][msg.sender] = allowed - shares;
            }
        }
    }

    unchecked {
        balanceOf[owner] = balance - shares;
        totalSupply      = totalSupply - shares;
    }

    bool success = nst.transfer(receiver, assets);
    require(success, "SNst/transfer-failed"); // Check the transfer

    emit Transfer(owner, address(0), shares);
    emit Withdraw(msg.sender, receiver, owner, assets, shares);
}
