# System cannot be turned back on after shutdown Period

## Description

In `Splitter.sol`, There is a variable `live` which is set to `1` upon deployment and to `0` when the contract is `caged` during global shutdown. The shutdown period is meant to be activated whenever there are discrepancies in the protocol. However, the current implementation does not make provision for activating the system back on after the issue might have been mitigated

## Impact
Contract is stuck and cannot be made `live` anymore due to no provision for the implementation.
Furthermore, the main core functionality of the `Splitter` contract which is `Kick` will no longer be callable, as it can only be called when `live == 1`

```solidity
    function kick(uint256 tot, uint256) external auth returns (uint256) {
   @->  require(live == 1, "Splitter/not-live"); //@audit

        require(block.timestamp >= zzz + hop, "Splitter/kicked-too-soon");
        zzz = block.timestamp;

        vat.move(msg.sender, address(this), tot);

        uint256 lot = tot * burn / RAD;
        if (lot > 0) {
            DaiJoinLike(daiJoin).exit(address(flapper), lot);
            flapper.exec(lot);
        }

        uint256 pay = (tot / RAY - lot);
        if (pay > 0) {
            DaiJoinLike(daiJoin).exit(address(farm), pay);
            farm.notifyRewardAmount(pay);
        }

        emit Kick(tot, lot, pay);
        return 0;
    }
```

## POC

```solidity
    function cage(uint256) external auth { //@audit no function to uncage and reset live back to 1. will no longer be able to kick
        live = 0;
        emit Cage(0);
    }
```

## Recommendation

Implement a function that allows resetting the `live` back to initial state after the system must have cooled down.
