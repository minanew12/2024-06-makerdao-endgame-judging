# LockStakeEngine::OnRemove wrong fee amount calculation

## Summary
The LockStakeEngine::onRemove function (called when an auction ends) collects the wrong amount of exit fee from the left collateral

## Vulnerability Detail
The LockStakeEngine::onRemove function is called by the LockstakeClipper contract when the auction ends. It passes the amount of collateral sold and the amount left, and the engine handles the leftovers in the following way: if any collateral is left after the auction, the engine collects the exit fee due for the sold collateral from the leftover-collateral. Whatever is left after that, is put back into the URN:

```solidity
function onRemove(address urn, uint256 sold, uint256 left) external auth {
        uint256 burn;
        uint256 refund;
        if (left > 0) {
            burn = _min(sold * fee / (WAD - fee), left);
            mkr.burn(address(this), burn);
            unchecked { refund = left - burn; }
            if (refund > 0) {
                // The following is ensured by the dog and clip but we still prefer to be explicit
                require(refund <= uint256(type(int256).max), "LockstakeEngine/overflow");
                vat.slip(ilk, urn, int256(refund));
                vat.frob(ilk, urn, urn, address(0), int256(refund), 0);
                lsmkr.mint(urn, refund);
            }
        }
        urnAuctions[urn]--;
        emit OnRemove(urn, sold, burn, refund);
    }
```

Note that the calculation used to determine the fee is `sold * fee / (WAD - fee)` (the burned amount is the minimum between the result and the leftover collateral). However, this calculation is wrong. The fee should be calculated using this formula: `uint256 burn = wad * fee_ / WAD;`, in the same way it is done in the _free function here:[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-makerdao-endgame/blob/dba30d7a676c20dfed3bda8c52fd6702e2e85bb1/lockstake/src/LockstakeEngine.sol#L373](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-makerdao-endgame/blob/dba30d7a676c20dfed3bda8c52fd6702e2e85bb1/lockstake/src/LockstakeEngine.sol#L373) because `fee_` is given as a ratio where WAD represents 1 as can be seen [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-makerdao-endgame/blob/dba30d7a676c20dfed3bda8c52fd6702e2e85bb1/lockstake/src/LockstakeEngine.sol#L140).

### Numeric Example

1. A URN with total collateral (Mkr) worth of $10500 is liquidated
2. At the end of the auction $10000 worth of collateral is sold and $500 worth is left
3. Assume the fee is 15% (quoting from the lockstake folder readme: *"(where `fee` will typically be 15%)"* )
4. The due fee is $10000*0.15 = $1500.
5. The fee calculated is $10000*0.15/(1-0.15) = $1764 
6. This means that an amount of Mkr worth $1764-$1500 = $264 is burned from the user's leftover Mkr unnecessarily causing them a loss.
7. In percentage terms: the user loses 264/10500 = 2.52% of the original urn collateral
8. If the exit fee increases above 20.7% , the user loses more than %5 of the collateral value

### Root cause
Wrong calculation of fee in LockStakeEngine::OnRemove: sold * fee / (WAD - fee) instead of sold * fee / WAD 


## Impact

As can be seen in the numeric example above, this error causes any liquidated user with enough leftover a loss of 2.5% typically and possibly above 5% depending of the value of fee.

## Recommendation
Fix the formula in the code above to the correct form: ` burn = _min(sold * fee / WAD , left);`
