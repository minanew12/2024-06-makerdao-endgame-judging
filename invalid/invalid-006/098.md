# Liquidation withdrawal fee is wrong, overcharging users by a factor of 1/(1-fee)

## Summary

The fee math is incorrect for post-liquidation amounts, overcharging them by a multiplicative factor  of 1/(1-fee)

## Vulnerability Detail

The LockstakeEngine has the goal of charging a fee on all "exits", whether these happen via a `free` or a `liquidation`

In the ordinary case the fee is assessed as:

```solidity
uint256 burn = wad * fee_ / WAD;
        if (burn > 0) {
            mkr.burn(address(this), burn);
        }
```

However, in the case of liquidations the fee is computed as:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-makerdao-endgame/blob/dba30d7a676c20dfed3bda8c52fd6702e2e85bb1/lockstake/src/LockstakeEngine.sol#L442-L444

```solidity
        if (left > 0) {
            burn = _min(sold * fee / (WAD - fee), left);
            mkr.burn(address(this), burn);
```

this leads to over-charging the fee by a factor of 1/(WAD-fee)

Given that MakerDAO's [governance settings intend to use double digit percentages](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#4-3-8-3) the impact will result in a substantial additional fee taken, to the detriment of liquidated accounts causing them an additional loss of funds compared to the intended amount



## Impact

The impact is effectively the same as taking an additional fee on the fee being assessed, these examples are based on [MIP-101](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101)

Ranging from 15% to 40%:
- We can see that at 15%, the math is taking an additional 17% of fee
- And at 40% an additional 66.67% is being assessed

## Recommendation

This line:
```solidity
burn = _min(sold * fee / (WAD - fee), left);
```

Should be changed to
```solidity
burn = _min(sold * fee / (WAD), left);
```
