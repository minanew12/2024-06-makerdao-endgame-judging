# No minimum threshold for distribute function

## Summary

The function `distribute` in its current form ensures that the amount to be distributed is greater than 0. However, it does not account for scenarios where the amount might be very small (e.g 1 or 1.0), which could lead to issues in the distribution process. Small amounts may lead to rounding errors. 
## Vulnerability Detail
If the amount is very small (e.g., 1 or 1.0), it could lead to negligible distributions which might not be effective or could incur unnecessary gas costs. For some tokens, transferring very small amounts might lead to precision issues or might be blocked by the token contract if it has minimum transfer amount requirements.
## Impact
The impact can range from moderate to high depending on the frequency and context of these small distributions. If small distributions occur frequently, the cumulative gas costs and operational inefficiencies can become significant.  This results in inefficient use of resources.
## Code Snippet
    function distribute() external returns (uint256 amount) {
        require(vestId != INVALID_VEST_ID, "VestedRewardsDistribution/invalid-vest-id");

        amount = dssVest.unpaid(vestId);
        require(amount > 0, "VestedRewardsDistribution/no-pending-amount");

        lastDistributedAt = block.timestamp;
        dssVest.vest(vestId, amount);

        require(gem.transfer(address(stakingRewards), amount), "VestedRewardsDistribution/transfer-failed");
        stakingRewards.notifyRewardAmount(amount);

        emit Distribute(amount);
    }
