# `LockstakeEngine.selectVoteDelegate` uses stored borrow rate for health calculation, making it possible to avoid liquidation by switching voteDelegate if nobody calls `jug.drip`.

### Summary

`LockstakeEngine.selectVoteDelegate` function requires the vault to be healthy if the new `VoteDelegate` is set. This is protection against abusing the `Chief`'s flashloan protection and `VoteDelegate`'s `reserveHatch` functionality: if user's vault is unhealthy, but user intentionally calls `VoteDelegate.lock`, liquidator can't liquidate the vault as liquidation will revert when trying to `free` in the same block (`Chief` flashloan protection). Liquidator can then call `VoteDelegate.reserveHatch`, which will disable `VoteDelegate.lock` function for 5 blocks, allowing liquidator to liquidate the vault. However, if the user is allowed to set a new `VoteDelegate` for unhealthy vault, then user can simply switch to a different `VoteDelegate` and `lock` there to prevent liquidations all the time. To protect against such behaviour, user's `Lockstake` vault is required to be healthy to select a new `VoteDelegate`.

The issue is that `selectVoteDelegate` uses stored debt rate, which can be outdated:
```solidity
    if (art > 0 && voteDelegate != address(0)) {
        (, uint256 rate, uint256 spot,,) = vat.ilks(ilk); // @audit << rate here is stored, new rate should be set by calling jug.drip
        require(ink * spot >= art * rate, "LockstakeEngine/urn-unsafe");
    }
```

The `vat` core module calculates user's debt as debt units (art) * borrow rate (rate). The rate increases every second by a set amount, however the rate increase is manual and user can call `jug.drip` to update the rate, however it is not required to do so anywhere in the core code. Thus the user's vault can be unhealthy (with current rate), however it's still healthy using the outdated rate from the last `jug.drip` call. Examining even the largest live `vat` collaterals reveals that `jug.drip` is called rather infrequently - a few times per hour or even per day.

This makes it possible for the user to abuse the `VoteDelegate.lock` and `selectVoteDelegate` if liquidator tries to call `reserveHatch`, preventing liquidation of unhealthy vault for up to several hours or even days, until `jug.drip` is called.

### Root Cause

`LockstakeEngine.selectVoteDelegate` uses stored (outdated) borrow rate:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-makerdao-endgame/blob/main/lockstake/src/LockstakeEngine.sol#L267

This allows to bypass the vault health check when changing `VoteDelegate` to prevent unhealthy vault liquidation.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `jug.drip` called infrequently (not called for several hours or days)
2. User is healthy if calculated using stored borrow rate, but unhealthy if calculated with actual current borrow rate.

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Attacker's vault has some `VoteDelegate` selected
2. Attacker's vault is healthy at the last stored borrow rate, but becomes unhealthy at the current rate
3. Attacker calls `VoteDelegate.lock` every block to prevent liquidation in the same block
4. Liquidator, being unable to liquidate user's vault (due to revert when trying to `VoteDelegate.free` in the liquidation), calls `VoteDelegate.reserveHatch`
5. Attacker calls `LockstakeEngine.selectVoteDelegate` with a different `VoteDelegate` and calls `VoteDelegate.lock` on this new delegate.
6. Repeat 3.

This can continue for a long time until `jug.drip` is called by someone. Since this is not required, this can continue for a long time (a few hours or days) until attacker's vault is in a bad debt, causing protocol losses.

### Impact

1. If the attacker's vault is large enough, attacker can DOS liquidators for a long time until the vault is in a bad debt, the losses can easily be up to 1%-10% of protocol funds.
2. Even if `jug.drip` is called more frequently, or no bad debt happens, liquidators are forced to call `VoteDelegate.reserveHatch` many times without actual liquidation happening, thus wasting gas fees. When done frequently, liquidators might be disincentivized from calling `reserveHatch` and liquidating such user, further exposing the protocol to uncontained losses from such attacker.

### PoC

Not needed

### Mitigation

Call `jug.drip` to get the borrow rate instead of getting it from the `vat`.
