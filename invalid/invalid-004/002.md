# PrecisionLoss in NotifyRewardAmount

## Summary
The `notifyRewardAmount` function in the smart contract has an incorrect validation mechanism for the reward rate. The current implementation uses integer division to check if the reward rate is within the contract's balance, leading to potential precision loss and incorrect validation, especially over long durations like 7 days. This can cause the function to pass invalid reward rates, resulting in incorrect reward distributions.

## Vulnerability Detail
The require statement intended to validate the reward rate uses integer division, which truncates the result, leading to potential precision loss. This can result in an incorrect validation of the reward rate, particularly in scenarios where the division leads to unexpected results due to truncation.

rewardsDuration = 7 days = 604800 seconds
balance = 1000000 tokens
rewardRate initially set to 0

Let's say we want to set reward = 500000 tokens.
```solidity
rewardRate = reward / rewardsDuration; // 500000 / 604800 ≈ 0.826 tokens per second
```
```solidity
balance / rewardsDuration = 1000000 / 604800 ≈ 1.653 tokens per second (integer division truncates to 1)
```
rewardRate ≈ 0.826
balance / rewardsDuration ≈ 1

Since 0.826 <= 1, the require statement passes.

Let assume a scenario where the balance is less than the RewardDuration due to reduction of balance and of that.
Assume balance = 10000 tokens and rewardsDuration = 7 days = 604800 seconds.

```solidity
rewardRate = reward / rewardsDuration; // 4 / 604800 ≈ 0 (since 4 < 604800)
```
```solidity
balance / rewardsDuration = 10 / 604800 ≈ 0 (integer division truncates to 0)
```
rewardRate = 0
balance / rewardsDuration = 0

Since 0 <= 0, the require statement passes. However, let's look at what happens in terms of rewards distribution:

Total distributed reward: rewardRate * rewardsDuration = 0 * 604800 = 0 tokens.
Given reward: 4 tokens.

## Impact
 Precision loss in the balance of tokens to be distributed to the stakers,  resulting in incorrect reward distributions.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function notifyRewardAmount(uint256 reward) external override onlyRewardsDistribution updateReward(address(0)) {
    if (block.timestamp >= periodFinish) {
        rewardRate = reward / rewardsDuration;
    } else {
        uint256 remaining = periodFinish - block.timestamp;
        uint256 leftover = remaining * rewardRate;
        rewardRate = (reward + leftover) / rewardsDuration;
    }

    // Ensure the provided reward amount is not more than the balance in the contract.
    // This keeps the reward rate in the right range, preventing overflows due to
    // very high values of rewardRate in the earned and rewardsPerToken functions;
    // Reward + leftover must be less than 2^256 / 10^18 to avoid overflow.
    uint256 balance = rewardsToken.balanceOf(address(this));
    require(rewardRate <= balance / rewardsDuration, "Provided reward too high");

    lastUpdateTime = block.timestamp;
    periodFinish = block.timestamp + rewardsDuration;
    emit RewardAdded(reward);
}
```
