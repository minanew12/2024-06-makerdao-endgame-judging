# Elevated Permission is required for rely and deny administration

## Summary

A compromised administrator already possessing auth access, can continually revert deny function on its address

## Vulnerability Detail

The permissions level of adding or removing an administrator is flat which can lead to a bunch of issues we will discuss in the impact. The flow of forcing revert of deny transaction on its address is:
- Compromised admin sees  deny txn 1 in mempool
- Compromised Admin frontruns the deny txn 1 and call deny txn 2 on caller of previous deny txn 1
- The deny txn 2 is successful and temporarily removes permission of caller of deny txn 1
- deny txn 1 is reverted due with "Ngt/not-authorized"
- Malicious admin then optinally calls rely txn 1 on the deny txn 1 caller as the goal is just to force keep elevated txn
- This leads to sandwiching a deny txn with deny and rely every time it is called

## Impact
If compromised admin is confirmed:
It impacts the `mint` function in all token contracts (nst, ngt and sdai)
It can also affect the `file` function in SNst.sol:file and VestedRewardsDistribution.sol:file

This means a compromised admin can likely not be removed by other admins which has a high impact but medium likelihood and will cause a lot of gas (funds) to combat the frontrunning or run multiple txns from multiple admins to force deny the compromised admin

## Recommendation
- Use elevated permissions on rely and deny like owner or super admin
