# Lack of deadline parameter in `take` can cause losses for the taker

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
The `take` function doesn't have a deadline parameter

```solidity
    function take(
        uint256 id,           // Auction id
        uint256 amt,          // Upper limit on amount of collateral to buy  [wad]
        uint256 max,          // Maximum acceptable price (DAI / collateral) [ray]
        address who,          // Receiver of collateral and external call address
        bytes calldata data   // Data to pass in external call; if length 0, no call is done
    ) external lock isStopped(3) {
```

A taker will call the take function when it is obtainable at no worse than open market price. But this estimation can become incorrect if the transaction doesn't get executed within a short timeframe and the price of the collateral decreases at a faster pace than the auction pricing. This will cause the taker to effectively suffer a loss
  
## Impact
Taker's/setup arbitrage bots can effectively loose value in times of network congestion and asset price decline

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a deadline parameter to restrict the allowed time for tx execution
