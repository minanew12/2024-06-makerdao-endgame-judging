# h-03 reentrant with stolen of funds 0xaliyah

## Summary

1. while the temp. var; `balance` L197 is the misinformation toward the effect at L201
2. while the temp. var; `balance` L197 is the lagging indication toward the effect at L201 if the `msg.sender` address was made any withdrawal or any transferFrom in the way that induced that reentry
3. L197 is the lagging indication
4. the `msg.sender` address made a withdrawal when the `transfer` function gave up control to the attacker at L197
5. given `msg.sender` is now emptied since L197 capturing and L197 now stale then L201 give the `msg.sender` address free increment

## Vulnerability Detail

1. recipients for free balance increment may be found

## Impact

1. high impact + high likeliness owasp
