# Replay Attack in VoteDelegateFactory Contract Creation Mechanism

## Summary
`create` function uses a deterministic salt derived from `msg.sender` for the `create2` opcode. This approach can lead to replay attacks, where the same user can only create one `VoteDelegate` contract, and any subsequent attempts will fail due to address collision.

## Vulnerability Detail
Issue: The `create` function uses `create2` with a salt derived from `msg.sender`:
```solidity
voteDelegate = address(new VoteDelegate{salt: bytes32(uint256(uint160(msg.sender)))}(chief, polling, msg.sender));
```
Problem: If the same user (`msg.sender`) calls `create` more than once, the salt remains the same, leading to the same contract address being generated. Since the address is already occupied by the first contract creation, subsequent calls will fail.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
-  Ensure that a `VoteDelegate` does not already exist for the user before allowing the creation of a new one. This prevents the replay attack by ensuring only one `VoteDelegate` per user.
```diff
function create() external returns (address voteDelegate) {
+   require(created[getAddress(msg.sender)] == 0, "VoteDelegate already exists");
    voteDelegate = address(new VoteDelegate{salt: bytes32(uint256(uint160(msg.sender)))}(chief, polling, msg.sender));
    created[voteDelegate] = 1;

    emit CreateVoteDelegate(msg.sender, voteDelegate);
}
```
- Incorporate a unique value, such as a nonce, to ensure each `create2` call generates a unique address, even for the same user.
```diff
- function create() external returns (address voteDelegate) {
-   voteDelegate = address(new VoteDelegate{salt: bytes32(uint256(uint160(msg.sender)))}(chief, polling, msg.sender));
+ function create(uint256 nonce) external returns (address voteDelegate) {
+   bytes32 salt = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, nonce));
+   voteDelegate = address(new VoteDelegate{salt: salt}(chief, polling, msg.sender));
    created[voteDelegate] = 1;

    emit CreateVoteDelegate(msg.sender, voteDelegate);
}
```
- Maintain a nonce for each user to ensure unique salts without requiring the user to provide a nonce.
```diff
+  mapping(address => uint256) private nonces;

function create() external returns (address voteDelegate) {
-   voteDelegate = address(new VoteDelegate{salt: bytes32(uint256(uint160(msg.sender)))}(chief, polling, msg.sender));
+   uint256 nonce = nonces[msg.sender]++;
+   bytes32 salt = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, nonce));
+   voteDelegate = address(new VoteDelegate{salt: salt}(chief, polling, msg.sender));
    created[voteDelegate] = 1;

    emit CreateVoteDelegate(msg.sender, voteDelegate);
}

```
