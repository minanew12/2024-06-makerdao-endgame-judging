# LockstakeClipper.yank did not process the burned lsmkr token

### Summary

LockstakeClipper.yank did not process the burned lsmkr token, resulting in loss of funds.

### Root Cause

When the user is liquidated, `lsmkr.burn` is executed in `LockstakeEngine.onKick`,
However, when canceling the auction using `LockstakeClipper.yank`, no processing is done on the lsmkr token.

LockstakeClipper.kick -> LockstakeEngine.onKick -> lsmkr.burn
```solidity
    function onKick(address urn, uint256 wad) external auth {
        // Urn confiscation happens in Dog contract where ilk vat.gem is sent to the LockstakeClipper
        (uint256 ink,) = vat.urns(ilk, urn);
        uint256 inkBeforeKick = ink + wad;
        _selectVoteDelegate(urn, inkBeforeKick, urnVoteDelegates[urn], address(0));
        _selectFarm(urn, inkBeforeKick, urnFarms[urn], address(0), 0);
@>    lsmkr.burn(urn, wad);
        urnAuctions[urn]++;
        emit OnKick(urn, wad);
    }
```

lsmkr token is not processed when yank:

```solidity
    function yank(uint256 id) external auth lock {
        require(sales[id].usr != address(0), "LockstakeClipper/not-running-auction");
        dog.digs(ilk, sales[id].tab);
        uint256 lot = sales[id].lot;
        vat.flux(ilk, address(this), msg.sender, lot);
        engine.onRemove(sales[id].usr, 0, 0);
        _remove(id);
        emit Yank(id);
    }

    function onRemove(address urn, uint256 sold, uint256 left) external auth {
        uint256 burn;
        uint256 refund;
        if (left > 0) {
            burn = _min(sold * fee / (WAD - fee), left);
            mkr.burn(address(this), burn);
            unchecked { refund = left - burn; }
            if (refund > 0) {
                // The following is ensured by the dog and clip but we still prefer to be explicit
                require(refund <= uint256(type(int256).max), "LockstakeEngine/overflow");
                vat.slip(ilk, urn, int256(refund)); 
                vat.frob(ilk, urn, urn, address(0), int256(refund), 0);
                lsmkr.mint(urn, refund);
            }
        }
        urnAuctions[urn]--;
        emit OnRemove(urn, sold, burn, refund);
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The user is liquidated and enters the auction state.
2. The auction is canceled

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The user is liquidated and enters the auction state.
2. The administrator calls `LockstakeClipper.yank` to cancel the auction.
3.  The lkmkr token burned during `LockstakeEngine.onKick` is not processed, resulting in a loss of funds.

### Impact

Cause the loss of funds.

### PoC
_No response_

### Mitigation

The `yank` function sends the burned `lsmkr token` to the `msg.sender`
