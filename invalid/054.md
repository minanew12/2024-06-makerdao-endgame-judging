# StakingRewards.setRewardsDuration allows setting near zero or enormous rewardsDuration`, which breaks reward logic

## Summary
rewardsDuration cab be set to zero and notifyRewardAmount will cease to produce meaningful results if rewardsDuration is too small or too big.
## Vulnerability Detail
The setter does not control the value, allowing zero/near zero/enormous duration:
function setRewardsDuration(uint256 _rewardsDuration) external onlyOwner updateReward(address(0)) {
        uint256 periodFinish_ = periodFinish;
        if (block.timestamp < periodFinish_) {
            uint256 leftover = (periodFinish_ - block.timestamp) * rewardRate;
            rewardRate = leftover / _rewardsDuration;
            periodFinish = block.timestamp + _rewardsDuration;
        }

        rewardsDuration = _rewardsDuration;
        emit RewardsDurationUpdated(rewardsDuration);
    }
## Impact
notifyRewardAmount will fail if rewardsDuration is too small or too big.

## Recommendation
Check for min and max range in the rewardsDuration setter, as too small or too big rewardsDuration breaks the logic.
