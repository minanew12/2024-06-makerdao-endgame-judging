# StakingRewards.recoverERC20 allows owner to rug the rewardsToken

## Summary
StakingRewards.recoverERC20 rightfully checks against the stakingToken being sweeped away.
However, there's no check against the rewardsToken which over time will sit in this contract.

This is the case of an admin privilege, which allows the owner to sweep the rewards tokens, perhaps as a way to rug depositors.
## Vulnerability Detail
 function recoverERC20(address tokenAddress, uint256 tokenAmount) external onlyOwner {
        require(tokenAddress != address(stakingToken), "Cannot withdraw the staking token");
        IERC20(tokenAddress).safeTransfer(owner, tokenAmount);
        emit Recovered(tokenAddress, tokenAmount);
    }
## Impact
Allows owner to rug the rewardsToken.
