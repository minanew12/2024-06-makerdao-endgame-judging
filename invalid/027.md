# The function `drip` will revert when diff is 0, which leads to the DOS of key functionalities.

### Summary

In `SNst.sol`, the function withdraw, redeem, mint and deposit will be DOSed as the function `drip` reverts. This problem will occur in the following two scenarios:
1. When the difference between block.timestamp and rho_ is small, it may cause nChi to be the same as chi_.
2. When the nsr is set to a smaller value, it may cause nChi to be the same as chi_. **An extreme case is when nsr=RAY, nChi will always be equal to chi_, which causes the contract to be permanently DOS until the admin updates it.**

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-makerdao-endgame/blob/main/sdai/src/SNst.sol#L214-L229

In `SNst.sol:220`, there is no check whether diff is 0, causing the parameter of `nstJoin.exit` to be 0.


### Internal pre-conditions

No pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

No pre-conditions

### Attack Path

Calls to the function withdraw, redeem, mint and deposit **may fail at any time**.

### Impact

Users will not be able to withdraw, redeem, mint and deposit.

### PoC

```solidity
    function testJoinExitZero() public {
        address receiver = address(123);
        assertEq(nst.balanceOf(receiver), 0);
        assertEq(vat.dai(address(this)), 10_000 * RAD);
        vm.expectRevert("Vat/not-allowed");
        nstJoin.exit(receiver, 4_000 * WAD);
        vat.hope(address(nstJoin));
        vm.expectEmit(true, true, true, true);
        emit Exit(address(this), receiver, 4_000 * WAD);
        nstJoin.exit(receiver, 0);
   }
```
Please put this piece of code in the file `NstJoin.t.sol`.
This piece of code will be reverted as the parameter of function nstJoin.exit is 0.

### Mitigation

before calling the nstJoin.exit, check where diff is 0.
