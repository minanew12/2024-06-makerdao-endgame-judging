# Utilizing LockStateClipper#yank will result in DOS of collateral being liquidated

## Summary

LockStateClipper#yank uses vat.flux to internally transfer the lsMKR ilk. Since it does not follow the same pattern as other ilk and lacks a join contract, this internal balance cannot be converted into real collateral.

## Vulnerability Detail

[LockstakeClipper.sol#L475-L484](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-makerdao-endgame/blob/main/lockstake/src/LockstakeClipper.sol#L475-L484)

    // Cancel an auction during End.cage or via other governance action.
    function yank(uint256 id) external auth lock {
        require(sales[id].usr != address(0), "LockstakeClipper/not-running-auction");
        dog.digs(ilk, sales[id].tab);
        uint256 lot = sales[id].lot;
        vat.flux(ilk, address(this), msg.sender, lot);
        engine.onRemove(sales[id].usr, 0, 0);
        _remove(id);
        emit Yank(id);
    }

Above we see that yank utilizes the flux command to move the internal collateral balance from the clipper to msg.sender. 

[LockstakeInit.sol#L241-L251](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-makerdao-endgame/blob/main/lockstake/deploy/LockstakeInit.sol#L241-L251)

        IlkRegistryLike(dss.chainlog.getAddress("ILK_REGISTRY")).put(
            cfg.ilk,
            address(0), //@audit-info no join address
            cfg.mkr,
            18,
            7, // New class
            pip,
            address(clipper),
            cfg.name,
            cfg.symbol
        );

We also see that lsMKR does not have a join since the lockstake engine effectively functions as it's join. As a result this internal is impossible to access. Instead a separate governance action is needed to call onTake to recover the underlying MKR. This could lead to a substantial delay in the liquidation leading to large amounts of bad debt being accumulated in the system to due a flaw in the contract.

Although for this contest it is assumed that ESM is never triggered, as stated in the contract comments it is expected that I could be called as part of other governance actions.

## Impact

Since these are funds directly queued for liquidation, the delay could lead to large amounts of excess bad debt in the system.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The methodology should be changed to utilize vat.slip and engine.onTake to effectively recover the collateral:

        // Cancel an auction during End.cage or via other governance action.
        function yank(uint256 id) external auth lock {
            require(sales[id].usr != address(0), "LockstakeClipper/not-running-auction");
            dog.digs(ilk, sales[id].tab);
            uint256 lot = sales[id].lot;
    --      vat.flux(ilk, address(this), msg.sender, lot);
    ++      vat.slip(ilk, address(this), -int256(lot));
    ++      engine.onTake(sales[id].usr, msg.sender, lot);
            engine.onRemove(sales[id].usr, 0, 0);
            _remove(id);
            emit Yank(id);
        }
