# A compromissed ward can take over all Nst contract

## Summary
There is no timelock for upgrades, which can be dangerous in case of admin key compromise as it allows for immediate, potentially malicious upgrades.

## Vulnerability Detail
The current implementation allows any address with ward status to upgrade the contract immediately without any delay or additional checks. This lack of a timelock mechanism creates a single point of failure if an admin key is compromised.

## Impact
A compromised admin could instantly upgrade the contract to a malicious implementation, potentially breaking invariants, stealing funds, or causing other severe damage to the system and its users.

## Code Snippet
[Nst.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-makerdao-endgame/blob/main/nst/src/Nst.sol#L1)
```solidity
function _authorizeUpgrade(address newImplementation) internal override auth {}
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a timelock mechanism for upgrades. This could be done by integrating with a separate timelock contract such as OZ TimelockController or by implementing a built-in delay. This approach provides a window for users to react to proposed upgrades and helps mitigate the risk of malicious immediate upgrades.
