# Front-Running Exploit in Reward Rate Update Mechanism

## Summary
The `StakingRewards` contract is vulnerable to a front-running exploit where an attacker can monitor pending transactions that update the reward rate and quickly stake tokens before the transaction is mined. This allows the attacker to earn disproportionately high rewards, undermining the fairness and economic balance of the staking system.

## Vulnerability Detail
1. An attacker monitors the blockchain for pending `notifyRewardAmount` transactions.
2. Upon detecting such a transaction, the attacker quickly sends a stake transaction with a large amount of tokens.
3. The attacker's transaction is mined before the `notifyRewardAmount` transaction, allowing them to stake tokens at the old reward rate.
4. Once the `notifyRewardAmount` transaction is mined, the reward rate is updated, and the attacker earns higher rewards than intended.

## Impact
- Unfair Advantage
- User Trust
- Economic Imbalance

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Introduce a delay between the announcement of a reward update and its actual application.
- Implement monitoring and alert systems to detect unusual staking activity that could indicate front-running attempts.
