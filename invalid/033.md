# After `StakingRewards` is paused, new rewards can still be added, resulting in rewards being claimed by existing stakers

## Summary

After `StakingRewards` is paused, new rewards can still be added, resulting in rewards being claimed by existing stakers.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `StakingRewards` contract can be paused. The only function affected is `stake`. Once the contract is paused, users will not be able to `stake`, but everything else remains normal.

When the contract is paused, the `notifyRewardAmount` function is still available. That is, the rewards are still being distributed. These rewards will flow into a small number of existing stakers, and others cannot claim these rewards by staking. In addition, the contract pause causes users to `withdraw`, making the existing stakers more profitable.

## Impact

The distribution of `StakingRewards` will become unreasonable, and the staking rewards will flow into a small number of existing stakers.

## Recommendation
