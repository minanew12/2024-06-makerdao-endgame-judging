# Call to non-existing contracts returns success

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
Low level calls (`call`, `delegatecall` and `staticcall`) return success if the called contract doesnâ€™t exist (not deployed or destructed)
As written in the [solidity documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/control-structures.html#error-handling-assert-
The low-level functions `call`, `delegatecall` and `staticcall` return true as their first return value if the account called is non-existent, as part of the design of the EVM. Account existence must be checked prior to calling if needed.

## Recommendation
Check for contract existence on low-level calls, so that failures are not missed.
