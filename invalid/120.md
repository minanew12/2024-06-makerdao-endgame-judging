# Contract is bricked after calling `stop`

## Description

Whenever there are discrepancies or irregularities and the protocol decides to stop or halt the `kick` process, there is currently no implementation to revert back to the initial state in `SplitterMom`. 

The `stop` calls the `splitter.file` with a new data of `type(uint256).max` as hop which will make it difficult to pass the below check :-
- `require(block.timestamp >= zzz + hop, "Splitter/kicked-too-soon");`

## Impact

Contract is stuck and `kick` can no longer be called.


## POC
```solidity
    function stop() external auth { //@audit there is no way to resume back after halting the operations. it will become impossible to call Splitter::Kick
            splitter.file("hop", type(uint256).max);
            emit Stop();
    }
```
## Recommendation

Implement a functionality that allows resetting the ` splitter.file` back to a more recent timestamp
