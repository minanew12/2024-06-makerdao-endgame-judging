# Front-Running Vulnerability due to Lack of TWAP Oracle in FlapperUniV2SwapOnly Contract

## Summary
The `FlapperUniV2SwapOnly` contract is vulnerable to front-running attacks due to its reliance on a spot price oracle (pip). This allows malicious actors to manipulate prices and exploit transactions for their own benefit.

## Vulnerability Detail
The contract `exec` function uses the current spot price from the `pip` oracle to determine the amount of GEM tokens to purchase in exchange for a given amount of DAI (`lot`). However, this spot price can be easily manipulated by front-runners who observe the pending transaction in the mempool. These attackers can quickly execute a similar trade before the original transaction is mined, causing the price to shift unfavorably and allowing them to profit from the price difference.

## Impact
Front-running attacks can lead to significant financial losses for users of the `FlapperUniV2SwapOnly` contract. The attacker gains an unfair advantage by manipulating the price, while the user receives a worse exchange rate for their trade. This can undermine trust in the contract and discourage users from participating.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-makerdao-endgame/blob/main/dss-flappers/src/FlapperUniV2SwapOnly.sol#L122-L123

```solidity
        uint256 _buy = _getAmountOut(lot, _reserveDai, _reserveGem);
        require(_buy >= lot * want / (uint256(pip.read()) * RAY / spotter.par()), "FlapperUniV2SwapOnly/insufficient-buy-amount");
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
recommended to replace the spot price oracle with a Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) oracle. A TWAP oracle calculates the average price of an asset over a period, making it much more difficult for attackers to manipulate prices in a single block.

```solidity
interface TWAPOracleLike {
    function consult(address token) external view returns (uint256 price, uint256 timestamp);
}

contract FlapperUniV2SwapOnly {
    // ... other variables

    TWAPOracleLike public twapOracle;

    // ... other functions

    function file(bytes32 what, address data) external auth {
        // ... 
        else if (what == "twapOracle") twapOracle = TWAPOracleLike(data);
        // ...
    }

    function exec(uint256 lot) external auth nonReentrant { 
        // ... (add minimum lot size check)

        // Use TWAP oracle
        (uint256 _price, ) = twapOracle.consult(gem);
        require(_buy >= lot * want / (_price * RAY / spotter.par()), "FlapperUniV2SwapOnly/insufficient-buy-amount"); 

        // ... (rest of the function logic)
    }
}
```
