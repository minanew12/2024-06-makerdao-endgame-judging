# Reentrancy Exploit in Yield Accumulation Mechanism of SNst Contract

## Summary
The `drip` function in the `SNst` is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks due to external calls to `vat.suck` and `nstJoin.exit` before updating critical state variables. This could allow an attacker to manipulate the state and drain funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Initial Call:
- `drip` is called.
- Calculates `nChi` and `diff`.
- Calls `vat.suck`.

2. Reentrant Call:
- If `vat.suck` or `nstJoin.exit` triggers a callback to `drip`, the function could be reentered before the state variables `chi` and `rho` are updated.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-makerdao-endgame/blob/main/sdai/src/SNst.sol#L221-L222
- This reentrant call would use the old values of `chi` and `rho`, leading to incorrect calculations and potential double spending of `diff`.

## Impact
- Financial Loss
- State Manipulation

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Use OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuard` to prevent reentrancy attacks.
```diff
+   import "@openzeppelin/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol";

-   contract SNst is UUPSUpgradeable {
+   contract SNst is UUPSUpgradeable, ReentrancyGuard {

-   function drip() public returns (uint256 nChi) {
+   function drip() public nonReentrant returns (uint256 nChi) {
        (uint256 chi_, uint256 rho_) = (chi, rho);
        uint256 diff;
        if (block.timestamp > rho_) {
            nChi = _rpow(nsr, block.timestamp - rho_) * chi_ / RAY;
            uint256 totalSupply_ = totalSupply;
            diff = totalSupply_ * nChi / RAY - totalSupply_ * chi_ / RAY;
            vat.suck(address(vow), address(this), diff * RAY);
            nstJoin.exit(address(this), diff);
            chi = uint192(nChi); // safe as nChi is limited to maxUint256/RAY (which is < maxUint192)
            rho = uint64(block.timestamp);
        } else {
            nChi = chi_;
        }
        emit Drip(nChi, diff);
    }
}
```
- Ensure all state changes occur before any external calls.
```diff
    function drip() public returns (uint256 nChi) {
        (uint256 chi_, uint256 rho_) = (chi, rho);
        uint256 diff;
        if (block.timestamp > rho_) {
            nChi = _rpow(nsr, block.timestamp - rho_) * chi_ / RAY;
            uint256 totalSupply_ = totalSupply;
            diff = totalSupply_ * nChi / RAY - totalSupply_ * chi_ / RAY;

            // Update state before external calls
+           chi = uint192(nChi);
+           rho = uint64(block.timestamp);

            vat.suck(address(vow), address(this), diff * RAY);
            nstJoin.exit(address(this), diff);
-           chi = uint192(nChi); // safe as nChi is limited to maxUint256/RAY (which is < maxUint192)
-           rho = uint64(block.timestamp);
        } else {
            nChi = chi_;
        }
        emit Drip(nChi, diff);
    }
```
