# `distribute` can be DOSed by an attacker


## Summary

The `VestedRewardsDistribution::distribute` can be bricked leading to users not able to earn rewards.

## Description
Anyone can call `VestedRewardsDistribution.distribute` which calls `StakingReward.notifyRewardAmount` and distributes the accumulated rewards to the users and sets a new periodFinish.

When a user calls `distribute`, the `unpaid` returns the amount of vested which is claimable and it makes a call to the `dssVest.vest` with the said amount in order to mint the required gem tokens needed. The `dssVest.vest` also has an implementation that gets the current  `unpaid` amount and compares it with the unpaid amount from the `distribute` function in order to get the minimum value.

The vulnerability lies in the fact that a malicious user can advantage of this by DOSing the distribute function making it difficult or impossible for legit users to earn rewards. 

The `unpaid` gotten in `distribute` might be different from the `unpaid` from the `vest`, and in this case the minimum is being selected according to this line from the `dssVest.vest` function ->
- `amt = min(amt, _maxAmt);`


```solidity
     function _vest(uint256 _id, uint256 _maxAmt) internal lock {
        Award memory _award = awards[_id];
        require(_award.usr != address(0), "DssVest/invalid-award");
        require(_award.res == 0 || _award.usr == msg.sender, "DssVest/only-user-can-claim");
        uint256 amt = unpaid(block.timestamp, _award.bgn, _award.clf, _award.fin, _award.tot, _award.rxd);
        amt = min(amt, _maxAmt);
        awards[_id].rxd = toUint128(add(_award.rxd, amt));
        pay(_award.usr, amt);
        emit Vest(_id, amt);
    }
``` 

From the above, the amount to be minted to the the `VestedRewardsDistribution` contract is based on the `amt = min(amt, _maxAmt);` which selects the min between the `amt` and `_maxAmt`. In the case whereby the selected amount  is the `amt` , it mints a lesser amount to the `VestedRewardsDistribution` when this happens, the `distribute()` tries to the initial amount to the `stakingRewards` contract. However, the transaction is going to fail because the specified amount will be insufficient. 


**Attack scenario**
- Malicious user `stake` some amounts
- Malicious user monitors the memepool for potential `distribute` calls.
- Legit User calls `distribute`
- `distribute` calculates amount as -> amount = dssVest.unpaid(vestId);
- Malicious front runs the tx and `withdraw` his staked amount
- `dssVest.vest` function is being called
- amount returned from `dssVest.vest` => amt = min(amt, _maxAmt); which is now lesser(minus malicious actors amount)
- `dssVest.vest` mints `amt` tokens to the `VestedRewardsDistribution` contract
- transfer in `distribution` fails due to contract not having enough tokens as the amount minted from `dssVest.vest` is lesser than what he is trying to send


## Impact
`distribute` can be DOSed making it very difficult or impossible for legit users to earn rewards

## POC

```solidity
    function distribute() external returns (uint256 amount) {
        require(vestId != INVALID_VEST_ID, "VestedRewardsDistribution/invalid-vest-id");

        amount = dssVest.unpaid(vestId);
        require(amount > 0, "VestedRewardsDistribution/no-pending-amount");

        lastDistributedAt = block.timestamp;
        dssVest.vest(vestId, amount);

        require(gem.transfer(address(stakingRewards), amount), "VestedRewardsDistribution/transfer-failed"); //@audit the transfer here will fail due to the fact the amount of gem minted to this contract is  smaller than the amount of gem its trying to send to the stakingRewards due to the fact that it is getting the unpaid twice, both here and in the vest function
        stakingRewards.notifyRewardAmount(amount);

        emit Distribute(amount);
    }
```

## Recommendation
Remove the `unpaid` logic from the `distribute()` function and only use the one from the `dssVest.vest`
