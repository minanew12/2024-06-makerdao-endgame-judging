# If a reward is distributed while there are no stakers, the reward is permanently lost.

## Summary
If a reward is distributed while there are no stakers, the reward is permanently lost.

## Vulnerability Detail
In [StakingRewards:144](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-makerdao-endgame/blob/dba30d7a676c20dfed3bda8c52fd6702e2e85bb1/endgame-toolkit/src/synthetix/StakingRewards.sol#L144), the `updateReward` modifier is called. The modifier includes the following code:

```solidity
rewardPerTokenStored = rewardPerToken();
lastUpdateTime = lastTimeRewardApplicable();
```
The first line sets `rewardPerTokenStored` to the result of the following function:
```solidity
function rewardPerToken() public view returns (uint256) {
        if (_totalSupply == 0) {
            return rewardPerTokenStored;
        }
        return
            rewardPerTokenStored + (((lastTimeRewardApplicable() - lastUpdateTime) * rewardRate * 1e18) / _totalSupply);
    }
```
When there are no stakers yet, `_totalSupply` is `0`. 

This means that `rewardPerTokenStored` is not updated if there are no stakers.

However at the same time, `lastUpdateTime` is updated to `block.timestamp`:
```solidity
function lastTimeRewardApplicable() public view returns (uint256) {
        return block.timestamp < periodFinish ? block.timestamp : periodFinish;
    }
```

Since the timestamp has been updated but the rewards per token have not, the rewards are effectively lost and stuck in the contract. 

## Impact
The rewards distributed to the `StakingRewards` contract are lost and un-redeemable.
