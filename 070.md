# `UniV2PoolMigratorInit` can lose some funds during migration due to rounding error, up to 29% in the worst case

### Summary

`UniV2PoolMigratorInit` migrates uniswap v2 DAI/MKR pool shares held by pause proxy to a new Uniswap v2 NST/NGT pool. This is done simply by burning all shares pause proxy has, converting amounts burnt to NST/NGT and minting pool shares in a fresh NST/NGT pool.

The issue is that the migrator transaction can be easily sandwitched by any user to manipulate the DAI/MKR pool and there is no check for such manipulation. Normally this should not be a problem, because the same amount should be burned and minted, thus the manipulated pool price doesn't matter. However, uniswap burn operation rounds down the funds sent to the shares holder, so there might be a small loss of 1 wei of either asset during the burn due to rounding error in favor of the pool. If the pool is manipulated such that there are only a few wei of either asset, then the loss of even 1 wei of assets for the burner will be significant as it will be relative to the amount of this assets he will receive. In the worst case (pool manipulated for the burner to receive 1 wei of asset instead of 2 wei), the loss is `1-1/sqrt(2) = 29%` 

### Simplified Example

Here is the simplified example to demonstrate what can happen. Here in the example the numbers are intentionally small and we omit uniswap fees for simplicity. For real attack numbers with full math see POC.

1. `DAI/MKR` pool has `2000 DAI / 2000 MKR`
2. Pause Proxy has 999 out of 1000 pool shares, meaning Pause Proxy has `1998 DAI / 1998 MKR`
3. Attacker sandwiches migrator transaction by first swapping in the pool: `+1998000 DAI, -1998 MKR` => new pool has `2000000 DAI / 2 MKR`
4. Attacker mints in the pool: `+2000000 DAI, +2 MKR` (receives 1000 pool shares) => new pool has `4000000 DAI / 4 MKR`
5. Migrator transaction executes, first burns 999 shares (out of 2000 pool shares) => receives `4000000 * 999 / 2000 = 1998000 DAI` and `4 * 999 / 2000 = round_down(1.998) = 1 MKR`. Pool now has `2002000 DAI / 3 MKR` and total of 1001 shares.
6. Migrator exchanges `1998000 DAI` into `1998000 NST`, `1 MKR` into `1 NGT` (assuming conversion rate = 1 for simplicity, any other conversion rate doesn't change anything)
7. Migrator mints new Uniswap v2 pool tokens: `+1998000 NST, +1 NGT`, receiving `1413` shares (ignore minimum pool liquidity shares for simplicity here as they will not be relevant in real math with larger numbers)
8. Attacker swaps: `+2448 MKR, -1999549 DAI` => pool has `2451 DAI / 2451 MKR`
9. Attacker burns `1000` shares, receiving back `2451 * 1000 / 1001 = 2448 DAI` and `2448 MKR` (pool has `3 DAI / 3 MKR`)
10. Attacker now gains the ability to exchange `DAI <-> NST` and `MKR <-> NGT` (since migrator transaction also opens up NST/NGT join contracts)
11. Attacker swaps in the new `NST/NGT` pool: `+1413 NGT, -1996586 NST` => pool has `1414 NST / 1414 NGT`

Pause proxy had `1998 DAI + 1998 MKR` before the migration, but due to attack now has `1414 NST + 1414 NGT` (a loss of `29%` of funds). 

Attacker had the following tokens flow:
1. DAI: `-1998000 - 2000000 + 1999549 + 2448 + 1996586 = +583`
2. MKR: `+1998 - 2 - 2448 + 2448 - 1413 = +583`

### PoC

The simplified example above demonstrates vulnerability, however it doesn't account for the following real-life limitations:
- In order to manipulate the pool to a state where some asset is only a few wei, the attacker needs about `k = asset0 * asset1` of either asset amount, which might not be available
- Uniswap v2 pool assets are `uint112`, but `k` can be larger, thus it might be impossible to move pool to a state where some asset is just a few wei.
- Since the amounts to manipulate the pool to such state are huge, fees paid by attacker might be much higher than the profit or prevent attack altogether.

Below is full math of the attack crafted with these considerations. We assume the following:
- All tokens are in WAD (18 decimals)
- Attacker can flash loan `400 million` of DAI for free (current DAI flash loan allows 500M amount)
- Pool fee is 0.3% (we use real uniswap v2 smart contract formulas to validate: after each swap `(assets0 * 1000 - amount0In * 3) * (assets1 * 1000 - amount1In * 3) >= prevAssets0 * prevAssets1 * 1000^2`)
- We take the maximum pool amounts which can be attacked under these assumptions: `k = 4e26`

1. `DAI/MKR` pool has `2e13 DAI / 2e13 MKR`
2. Pause Proxy has `1445667567158614797133434` out of `1446043365914720423651566` pool shares, meaning Pause Proxy has 99.974% of all pool funds (real current pool amounts)
3. Attacker sandwiches migrator transaction by first swapping in the pool `200M DAI`: `+200599999999979940000000000 DAI, -19999999999998 MKR` => new pool has `200599999999999940000000000 DAI / 2 MKR`
4. Attacker mints in the pool with `200M DAI`: `+200599999999999940000000000 DAI, +2 MKR` (receives `1446043365914720423651566` pool shares) => new pool has `401199999999999880000000000 DAI / 4 MKR`
5. Migrator transaction executes, first burns `1445667567158614797133434` shares (out of `2892086731829440847303132` pool shares) => receives `401199999999999880000000000 * 1445667567158614797133434 / 2892086731829440847303132 = 200547867932420415930853443 DAI` and `4 * 1445667567158614797133434 / 2892086731829440847303132 = round_down(1.99948) = 1 MKR`. Pool now has `200652132067579464069146557 DAI / 3 MKR` and total of `1446419164670826050169698` shares.
6. Migrator exchanges `200547867932420415930853443 DAI` into `200547867932420415930853443 NST`, `1 MKR` into `24000 NGT` (assuming conversion rate = 24000 as mentioned by the sponsor)
7. Migrator mints new Uniswap v2 pool tokens: `+200547867932420415930853443 NST, +24000 NGT`, receiving `2193888974030751` shares (1000 shares minted to prevent first depositor attack, total pool shares = `2193888974031751`)
8. Attacker swaps: `+24608625574350 MKR, -200652132067554929269448928 DAI` => pool has `24534799697629 DAI / 24608625574353 MKR`
9. Attacker burns `1446043365914720423651566` shares, receiving back `24534799697629 * 1446043365914720423651566 / 1446419164670826050169698 = 24528425233412 DAI` and `24608625574353 * 1446043365914720423651566 / 1446419164670826050169698 = 24602231929200 MKR` (pool has `6374464217 DAI / 6393645153 MKR`)
10. Attacker now gains the ability to exchange `DAI <-> NST` and `MKR <-> NGT` (since migrator transaction also opens up NST/NGT join contracts)
11. Attacker swaps in the new `NST/NGT` pool: `+340898513935905660 NGT, -200547867932406254438420354 NST` => pool has `14161492433089 NST / 340898513935929660 NGT`

Pause proxy had `1.999e13 DAI + 1.999e13 MKR` before the migration, but due to attack now has `1.416e13 NST + 34089 NGT (=1.420e13 MKR)` (a loss of `29%` of funds). 

Attacker had the following tokens flow:
1. DAI: `-200599999999979940000000000 - 200599999999999940000000000 + 200652132067554929269448928 + 24528425233412 + 200547867932406254438420354 = 0.5832133102694e13`
2. MKR: `+19999999999998 - 2 - 24608625574350 + 24602231929200 - 14204104747330 = +0.5789501607516e13`

As can be seen from the example, the pool fees do not significantly impact the attack. However, the pool available amounts and available flash loan amount do affect it. The scenario shown is for max impact of the attack. Rough calculations show that this attack can still be performed on a smaller scale with about the following limitations:
- Migrator loss: 0.5% or more
- Pool `k <= 1e32`
- Available DAI flash loan amount: `10 billion`

### Root Cause

Lack of Uniswap v2 pool manipulation check before burning shares during migration:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-makerdao-endgame/blob/main/univ2-pool-migrator/deploy/UniV2PoolMigratorInit.sol#L58-L59

Assets amount being sent to user are rounded down during calculations in Uniswap v2 `burn`:
https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-core/blob/ee547b17853e71ed4e0101ccfd52e70d5acded58/contracts/UniswapV2Pair.sol#L144-L145

This allows to manipulate the pool to a state where the rounding error becomes significant.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Uniswap v2 DAI/MKR pool assets amounts multiplied are `k <= 1e32`. Since both DAI and MKR are in WAD, this means pause proxy's pool amounts have to be very small (1 DAI / 0.0001 MKR or 1M DAI / 1e-10 MKR if MKR price rises significantly). While extremely unlikely, this might still be possible if MKR price rises significantly and most pool liquidity is withdrawn before migration.
2. Available DAI flash loan amount: `500 million - 10 billion`
3. Attacker sandwiches pool migrator spell

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Migrator spell is available to be executed permissionlessly by anyone
2. Attacker does in 1 transaction:
2.1. Take DAI flash loan
2.2. Manipulate Uniswap v2 DAI/MKR pool by swapping DAI to MKR to bring total MKR pool amount to 2 - 20000
2.3. Deposit large amount of DAI + MKR into the pool (up to current pool amount, but can be less for smaller impact)
2.4. Allow the migrator spell to execute, burning pause proxy shares while losing 1 MKR due to rounding error
2.5. Swap back DAI/MKR pool and burn liquidity
2.6. Swap NST/NGT pool to bring it to about current price

In the end the new pool will have 0.5%-29% less funds than before the migration, most of which is attacker's profit (and a small amount goes back into the DAI/MKR pool)

For more exact math see the PoC section.

### Impact

Attacker steals 0.5%-29% from the pool being migrated by the `UniV2PoolMigratorInit`.

### Mitigation

Consider doing a sanity check on pool reserve amounts - require them to be above 1e6 to prevent the attack.
