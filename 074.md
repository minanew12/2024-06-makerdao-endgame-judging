# The StakingRewards will be sandwich attacked

### Summary

When `rewardRate` or `rewardPerToken` is increased, the attacker runs the `stake token` forward, The attacker gains a reward after the `rewardPerToken` is increased, and finally stakes the token, the attacker loses nothing and contributes nothing to the protocol, but gains a reward.

### Root Cause
1. An attacker can immediately unstake(withdraw) after a stake token:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-makerdao-endgame/blob/dba30d7a676c20dfed3bda8c52fd6702e2e85bb1/endgame-toolkit/src/synthetix/StakingRewards.sol#L102-L121

```solidity
    function stake(uint256 amount) public nonReentrant notPaused updateReward(msg.sender) {
        require(amount > 0, "Cannot stake 0");
        _totalSupply = _totalSupply + amount;
        _balances[msg.sender] = _balances[msg.sender] + amount;
        stakingToken.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        emit Staked(msg.sender, amount);
    }
    function withdraw(uint256 amount) public nonReentrant updateReward(msg.sender) {
        require(amount > 0, "Cannot withdraw 0");
        _totalSupply = _totalSupply - amount;
        _balances[msg.sender] = _balances[msg.sender] - amount;
        stakingToken.safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
        emit Withdrawn(msg.sender, amount);
    }
```

2. The reward is calculated as follows:

```solidity
    function earned(address account) public view returns (uint256) {
        return (_balances[account] * (rewardPerToken() - userRewardPerTokenPaid[account])) / 1e18 + rewards[account];
    }
```
The attacker has a stake before the `rewardPerToken` is increased, and `userRewardPerTokenPaid` is the old value, so the user can get the reward after the increase.

3. `notifyRewardAmount` assigns rewards based on time, but this does not prevent sandwich attack:
If `periodFinish` is updated with a long interval, the increment of `rewardPerToken` after `rewardRate` is added is:
 deltaRewardRate = rewardRate * UpdateTimeInterval

After rewardRate is updated, but the interval is shorter, the value of 'rewardPerToken' is increased less, and the attacker can get less reward at this time,

But attackers can wait for the right moment to strike, If `lastUpdateTime` is not updated after a long time, the attacker finds that another user calls `lastUpdateTime`(or triggers itself), and the time difference is large and the increment of `rewardPerToken` is large, the attacker can implement the sandwich attack again.

```solidity
    //  rewardPerToken += ((lastTimeRewardApplicable() - lastUpdateTime) * rewardRate * 1e18) / _totalSupply
    function rewardPerToken() public view returns (uint256) {
        if (_totalSupply == 0) {
            return rewardPerTokenStored;
        }
        return
            rewardPerTokenStored + (((lastTimeRewardApplicable() - lastUpdateTime) * rewardRate * 1e18) / _totalSupply);
    }
```
### Internal pre-conditions
The protocol calculates the reward based on the user's _balances.

### External pre-conditions
The share of rewards allocated to users increases.

### Attack Path
1. The attacker found that the share of rewards increased.
2. Attackers use `front-running` to stake tokens and increase their balances before the share increases.
3. The share of rewards increases and the attacker gets a reward.
4. The attacker withdrew tokens.
5. An attacker can use flash-loans to attack.

### Impact

The attacker loses nothing and contributes nothing to the protocol, but gains a reward.

### PoC

### Mitigation
Add time lock when extracting revenue.
