# After the stop level of `LockstakeClipper` is reduced from `3`, users can buy collateral at extremely low prices

## Summary

After the stop level of `LockstakeClipper` is reduced from `3`, users can buy collateral at extremely low prices

## Vulnerability Detail

The `LockstakeClipper` contract has 4 stopped levels

- `0`: no breaker
- `1`: no new auctions
- `2`: no new auctions or restarted auctions
- `3`: no new auctions, restart auctions and buys

`LockstakeClipper` uses a dutch auction, which means that the longer the auction starts, the lower the price of the collateral. When the `stopped` is set to 3, no one can buy collateral, but the price is still falling. Once `stopped` is changed, users can immediately buy collateral at a very low price.

## Impact

Users can buy collateral at a lower price, causing losses to the protocol.

## Recommendation
