# Insufficient liquidity in the uniswap pool may result in the inability to distribute farm rewards

## Summary

Insufficient liquidity in the uniswap pool may result in the inability to distribute farm rewards.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `Splitter.kick` function splits the received DAI into two parts

- Call `flapper.exec` to hand it over to the burn engine for processing
- Call `farm.notifyRewardAmount` to add rewards to the farm

For the former, some burn engines (`FlapperUniV2` and `FlapperUniV2SwapOnly`) will sell DAI in the uniswap pool. To prevent arbitrage, they will limit the selling price based on the oracle price.

Once the liquidity of the uniswap pool is low, the price impact will trigger the price limit and the swap will fail. More seriously, it will also cause the farm rewards to be unable to be distributed.

## Impact

Farm rewards cannot be distributed and users lose staking rewards.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended that `Splitter.kick` isolate the DAI of flapper and farm.
