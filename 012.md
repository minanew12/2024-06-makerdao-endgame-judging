# MEV bots or regular users will frontrun the `univ2-pool-migrator` script and cause loss of funds for Maker

### Summary

The script `UniV2PoolMigratorInit` [burns](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-makerdao-endgame/blob/main/univ2-pool-migrator/deploy/UniV2PoolMigratorInit.sol#L58-L59) the `lp` tokens of the old $DAI $MKR pair without checking minimum amounts or setting a deadline. Thus, mev bots or regular users may frontrun the spell with swaps, modifying the reserves and causing Maker to take a significant loss. The sensitiveness of burning tokens to the reserves can be confirmed by the fact that the `UniswapV2Router` specifically [asks](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v2/reference/smart-contracts/router-02#removeliquidity) for minimum amounts out and deadline arguments and the $DAI $MKR `UniswapV2` pool presents significant price variation at times.

### Root Cause

In `UniV2PoolMigratorInit.sol`, the `lps` from the $DAI $MKR pair are [burned](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-makerdao-endgame/blob/main/univ2-pool-migrator/deploy/UniV2PoolMigratorInit.sol#L58-L59) and the received amounts are not checked against a threshold deviation nor a deadline is enforced.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

1. Regular price movement that results in Maker taking a loss, which is likely as the pair is volatile or MEV can be performed.

### Attack Path

1. Maker executes the `UniV2PoolMigratorInit` script.
2. Users or a MEV bot frontruns the script and modifies the price.
3. The script is executed and Maker takes a loss and receives a very different number of $DAI and $MKR tokens.

### Impact

Maker takes a loss and receives less total value than expected. The amount of tokens received can vary significantly as the price is very volatile, as shown in the `POC` section, in just 1 minuted it changed `0.1%` up to `5.38%` in 1 day.

### PoC

[Here](https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/pools/0x517f9dd285e75b599234f7221227339478d0fcc8) can be seen that at the time of writing, the price is volatile and changed `0,1%`, `1.1%`, `1.84%`, `5.38%` in the last 1 minute, 5 minutes, 6 hours, 24 hours. Thus, there is a big uncertainty in the amount of tokens actually received.

### Mitigation

Check the amounts received and ideally place a deadline to mitigate this loss, similarly to the validations performed in the [router](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v2/reference/smart-contracts/router-02#removeliquidity).
