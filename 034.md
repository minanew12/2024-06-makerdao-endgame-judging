# `StakingRewards.setRewardsDuration` will change the duration of an existing reward distribution

## Summary

`StakingRewards.setRewardsDuration` will change the duration of an existing reward distribution

## Vulnerability Detail

The `setRewardsDuration` function is used to update the `rewardsDuration` global variable. If the current reward has not ended, `setRewardsDuration` will update the end time of the current reward. This leads to the possibility that it may affect the legitimacy of current rewards. For example.

1. The current `rewardsDuration` is 30 days, so the amount of rewards added each time is the amount of 30 days
2. There is currently a reward, 1 day has been allocated and 29 days are left
3. The admin calls `setRewardsDuration` to update `rewardsDuration` to 5 days, and the amount of rewards added each time in the future is 5 days
4. The current reward rate will increase by `29/5 = 5.8` times

Even if future rewards are reasonable, the current reward rate becomes unreasonable.

## Impact

The reward rate becomes unreasonable and users may take the opportunity to arbitrage.
