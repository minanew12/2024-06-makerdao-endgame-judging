# `LockstakeEngine` operators can call `hope` infinitely to prevent themselves from being `nope`

## Summary

`LockstakeEngine` operators can call `hope` infinitely to prevent themselves from being `nope`.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `LockstakeEngine.hope` function is used to grant operator permissions to a certain address. It allows the position owner or operator to call it. And it can grant unlimited addresses as operators.

Operators can use this function to authorize an unlimited number of addresses, making it impossible for users to deauthorize them. In more serious cases, users may mistakenly believe that they have revoked authorization.

## Impact

Users cannot delete operator permissions. And users may mistakenly think that they have deleted operator permissions and not transfer positions.
