# Cache issue, user's funds are sent to the unintended ``urnFarm`` and ``voteDelegate``.

### Summary

#### Missing resetting of ``urnFarm`` and ``voteDelegate`` addresses after doing ``free``. 


#### Causing users' funds to be sent to unwanted ``urnFarm`` and ``voteDelegate`` addresses. when they want to ``lock`` again after doing ``free``, but not to lock or stake on the previous ``urnFarm`` and ``voteDelegate``.

### Root Cause

Look at this function [_free](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-makerdao-endgame/blob/dba30d7a676c20dfed3bda8c52fd6702e2e85bb1/lockstake/src/LockstakeEngine.sol#L360-L378):
```solidity
function _free(address urn, uint256 wad, uint256 fee_) internal returns (uint256 freed) {
        require(wad <= uint256(type(int256).max), "LockstakeEngine/overflow");
        address urnFarm = urnFarms[urn];
        if (urnFarm != address(0)) {
=>            LockstakeUrn(urn).withdraw(urnFarm, wad);
        }
        lsmkr.burn(urn, wad);
        vat.frob(ilk, urn, urn, address(0), -int256(wad), 0);
        vat.slip(ilk, urn, -int256(wad));
        address voteDelegate = urnVoteDelegates[urn];
        if (voteDelegate != address(0)) {
=>            VoteDelegateLike(voteDelegate).free(wad);
        }
        uint256 burn = wad * fee_ / WAD;
        if (burn > 0) {
            mkr.burn(address(this), burn);
        }
        unchecked { freed = wad - burn; } // burn <= wad always
    }
```
### Look at the code, there is no resetting ``urnFarm`` and ``voteDelegate`` to address(0) after "withdraw" and "free".

**So, when the user does ``free`` when ``urnFarm`` and ``voteDelegate`` are not at address(0) / where the user has funds in ``urnFarm`` and ``voteDelegate``, it will "withdraw" and "free" the user's funds in ``urnFarm`` and ``voteDelegate``, but after that it is not reset to address(0).**

**Then, when the user does ``lock`` again. It will send user funds to the previous ``urnFarm`` and ``voteDelegate`` addresses without user permission.**

```solidity
function _lock(address urn, uint256 wad, uint16 ref) internal {
        require(urnOwners[urn] != address(0), "LockstakeEngine/invalid-urn");
        require(wad <= uint256(type(int256).max), "LockstakeEngine/overflow");
        address voteDelegate = urnVoteDelegates[urn];
        if (voteDelegate != address(0)) {
            mkr.approve(voteDelegate, wad);
=>            VoteDelegateLike(voteDelegate).lock(wad);
        }
        vat.slip(ilk, urn, int256(wad));
        vat.frob(ilk, urn, urn, address(0), int256(wad), 0);
        lsmkr.mint(urn, wad);
        address urnFarm = urnFarms[urn];
        if (urnFarm != address(0)) {
            require(farms[urnFarm] == FarmStatus.ACTIVE, "LockstakeEngine/farm-deleted");
=>            LockstakeUrn(urn).stake(urnFarm, wad, ref);
        }
    }
```

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

- User funds are sent to unwanted ``urnFarm`` and ``voteDelegate`` addresses.

- Although the user can change this after or before locking again, this actually violates the user's policy and wishes.

- Before "lock" again; the user calls ``selectVoteDelegate`` and ``selectFarm`` first to address zero, then calls ``selectVoteDelegate`` and ``selectFarm`` again to the desired address. This consumes a lot of effort and time.

- After "lock" again; the user calls ``selectVoteDelegate`` and ``selectFarm`` to the desired address. But if he does not want previous funds to be sent to the unwanted ``urnFarm`` and ``voteDelegate`` addresses for some reason. So, this violates the user policy.

### PoC

- paste the code below into LockstakeEngine.t.sol
- run with ``forge test -vv --match-test test_lock_again_after_free``
```solidity
function test_lock_again_after_free() public {
        address andi = makeAddr("andi");
        deal(address(mkr), andi, 100_000 * 10 ** 18);
        vm.startPrank(andi);
        mkr.approve(address(engine), 100_000 * 10 ** 18);

        address urnAndi = engine.open(0);
        address voteDelegate_andi = voteDelegateFactory.create();
        engine.lock(urnAndi, 100_000 * 10 ** 18, 5);
        // lock to voteDelegate_andi
        engine.selectVoteDelegate(urnAndi, voteDelegate_andi);
        assertEq(mkr.balanceOf(voteDelegate_andi), 100_000 * 10 ** 18);

        engine.free(urnAndi, andi, 100_000 * 10 ** 18);
        assertEq(mkr.balanceOf(voteDelegate_andi), 0);
        console.log("andi's fund in old voteDelegate after free:", mkr.balanceOf(voteDelegate_andi));

        deal(address(mkr), andi, 100_000 * 10 ** 18);
        mkr.approve(address(engine), 100_000 * 10 ** 18);
        engine.lock(urnAndi, 100_000 * 10 ** 18, 5);
        assertEq(mkr.balanceOf(voteDelegate_andi), 100_000 * 10 ** 18);
        console.log("andi lock again, but the funds sent were to the old voteDelegate:", mkr.balanceOf(voteDelegate_andi));
    }
```

### Mitigation

- Reset  ``urnFarm`` and ``voteDelegate`` addresses after free
```solidity
   function _free(address urn, uint256 wad, uint256 fee_) internal returns (uint256 freed) {
        require(wad <= uint256(type(int256).max), "LockstakeEngine/overflow");
        address urnFarm = urnFarms[urn];
        if (urnFarm != address(0)) {
-            LockstakeUrn(urn).withdraw(urnFarm, wad); // remove this code
+            _selectFarm(urn, wad, urnFarm, address(0), 0);
        }
        lsmkr.burn(urn, wad);
        vat.frob(ilk, urn, urn, address(0), -int256(wad), 0);
        vat.slip(ilk, urn, -int256(wad));
        address voteDelegate = urnVoteDelegates[urn];
        if (voteDelegate != address(0)) {
-             VoteDelegateLike(voteDelegate).free(wad); // remove this code
+           _selectVoteDelegate(urn, wad, voteDelegate, address(0));
        }
        uint256 burn = wad * fee_ / WAD;
        if (burn > 0) {
            mkr.burn(address(this), burn);
        }
        unchecked { freed = wad - burn; } // burn <= wad always
    }
```
