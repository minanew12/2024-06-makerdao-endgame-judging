# Potential for allowance front-running in transferFrom function

### Summary

The transferFrom function is susceptible to the well-known ERC20 allowance front-running attack. If a user wants to change their allowance from a non-zero value to another non-zero value, an attacker can front-run the transaction and spend the old allowance + the new allowance

### Root Cause
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-makerdao-endgame/blob/main/lockstake/src/LockstakeMkr.sol#L79C5-L103C6

    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 value) external returns (bool) {
        require(to != address(0) && to != address(this), "LockstakeMkr/invalid-address");
        uint256 balance = balanceOf[from];
        require(balance >= value, "LockstakeMkr/insufficient-balance");


        if (from != msg.sender) {
            uint256 allowed = allowance[from][msg.sender];
            if (allowed != type(uint256).max) {
                require(allowed >= value, "LockstakeMkr/insufficient-allowance");


                unchecked {
                    allowance[from][msg.sender] = allowed - value;
                }
            }
        }


        unchecked {
            balanceOf[from] = balance - value;
            balanceOf[to] += value; // note: we don't need an overflow check here b/c sum of all balances == totalSupply
        }


        emit Transfer(from, to, value);


        return true;
    }

### Attack Path

Initial state:

Alice (token holder) has 1000 tokens
Alice has approved Bob (spender) to spend 100 tokens


Alice decides to change Bob's allowance to 50 tokens:

Alice submits a transaction to call approve(Bob, 50)


Bob (the attacker) sees this transaction in the mempool and quickly submits two transactions with a higher gas price:

Transaction 1: transferFrom(Alice, Bob, 100) (using the old allowance)
Transaction 2: transferFrom(Alice, Bob, 50) (using the new allowance)


The transactions are processed in this order due to Bob's higher gas price:

Bob's Transaction 1 executes, transferring 100 tokens from Alice to Bob
Alice's approve transaction executes, setting Bob's allowance to 50
Bob's Transaction 2 executes, transferring another 50 tokens from Alice to Bob


Result:

Bob has successfully transferred 150 tokens from Alice, even though Alice only intended to allow a maximum of 100 tokens (the original allowance) or 50 tokens (the new allowance)

### Impact

Users will lose their money. An attacker can front-run the transaction and spend the old allowance + the new allowance

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To mitigate this issue, one common solution is to implement an increaseAllowance and decreaseAllowance function instead of approve. Another approach is to first set the allowance to 0 and then to the desired value in two separate transactions, but this is less convenient for users.

`function increaseAllowance(address spender, uint256 addedValue) public returns (bool) {
    allowance[msg.sender][spender] += addedValue;
    emit Approval(msg.sender, spender, allowance[msg.sender][spender]);
    return true;
}

function decreaseAllowance(address spender, uint256 subtractedValue) public returns (bool) {
    uint256 currentAllowance = allowance[msg.sender][spender];
    require(currentAllowance >= subtractedValue, "ERC20: decreased allowance below zero");
    unchecked {
        allowance[msg.sender][spender] = currentAllowance - subtractedValue;
    }
    emit Approval(msg.sender, spender, allowance[msg.sender][spender]);
    return true;
}`
