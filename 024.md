# Owner possible to set `Owner` and `Authority` to the zero address.

## Summary
The `SplitterMom` contract has two functions, `setOwner` and `setAuthority`, that allow changing the contract owner's address (`owner`) and the authority address (`authority`). However, neither function includes checks to prevent these addresses from being set to the zero address (`0x0`).

## Vulnerability Detail
- `setOwner(address _owner)`: This function allows the current owner to change the contract's owner. However, it does not verify if the new `_owner` address is the zero address.
- `setAuthority(address _authority)`: This function allows the current owner to change the authority address. Similar to setOwner, it does not check if the new `_authority` address is the zero address.

## Impact
Setting owner or authority to the zero address can lead to the following consequences:
- Loss of Control: If `owner` is set to the zero address, it will be impossible to change the owner or authority again, rendering the contract unmanageable.
- Increased Security Risk: If `authority` is set to the zero address, the authority-based access control mechanism will be disabled, making the contract more vulnerable to attacks.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-makerdao-endgame/blob/main/dss-flappers/src/SplitterMom.sol#L68-L76

```solidity
    function setOwner(address _owner) external onlyOwner {
        owner = _owner;
        emit SetOwner(_owner);
    }

    function setAuthority(address _authority) external onlyOwner {
        authority = _authority;
        emit SetAuthority(_authority);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
require checks should be added to both functions to ensure that the provided new addresses are not the zero address:

```solidity
function setOwner(address _owner) external onlyOwner {
+    require(_owner != address(0), "SplitterMom/new-owner-cannot-be-zero");
    owner = _owner;
    emit SetOwner(_owner);
}

function setAuthority(address _authority) external onlyOwner {
+    require(_authority != address(0), "SplitterMom/new-authority-cannot-be-zero");
    authority = _authority;
    emit SetAuthority(_authority);
}
```
