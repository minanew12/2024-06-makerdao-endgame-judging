# The implementation of ward/rely/deny in the project may cause administrators to lose their privileges and could also result in malicious grantees having permanent access.

## Summary

The implementation of ward/rely/deny in the project may cause administrators to lose their privileges and could also result in malicious grantees having permanent access.

## Vulnerability Detail

Malicious grantees can call the deny() function to revoke the administratorâ€™s privileges.

They can also call the rely() function to increase their privileges so that they can retain them even after authorization is revoked.

## Recommendation
It is necessary to grant higher permissions to the "rely" and "deny" actions.
