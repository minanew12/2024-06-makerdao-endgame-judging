# Token Transfer Failure Due to Non-Standard ERC20 Implementation

## Summary
The `gem.transfer` function is used to transfer tokens in `VestedRewardsDistribution`. `StakingRewards` does not have a function that returns a boolean value, this can lead to unexpected behavior and potential failures in the token transfer process.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `gem.transfer` function is called in the distributed function to transfer tokens from `VestedRewardsDistribution` to `StakingRewards`. The ERC20 standard specifies that the transfer function must return a boolean value indicating the success of the transfer. However, not all ERC20 token implementations adhere strictly to this standard. Some tokens may revert to their original state on failure or return nothing, which can cause the `gem.transfer` call to behave unexpectedly.

## Impact
- Silent Failures
- Security Risks
- Operational Issues

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use OpenZeppelin's `SafeERC20` library to handle token transfers. The `safeTransfer` function provided by this library ensures that transfers succeed by correctly handling non-standard ERC20 implementations.
