# The LockStakeClipper Take function prices the Dutch auction incorrectly based on a stale market price

## Summary
The LockStakeClipper dutch auction mechanism incorrectly calculates the Take() price based on the price at the time the auction started rather than an updated oracle price. This distorts the Dutch auction logic (since liquidator profitability depends on the auction price diff from the **current** market price) leading to either bad debt or loss for liquidated URN owners as explained below.

## Vulnerability Detail
The LockStakeClipper contract manages a Dutch auction, where collateral is offered for sale at a high starting price ('buf' percent above the market price) and gradually drops the price over time (using a formula defined in the AabacusLike calc contract) until the price makes the trade profitable enough for a liquidator to take the offer.

The price is initialized in the kick() function (at the start of the auction) to the oracle market price plus the buf ratio.
```solidity
sales[id].tic = uint96(block.timestamp);

uint256 top;
top = rmul(getFeedPrice(), buf);
require(top > 0, "LockstakeClipper/zero-top-price");
sales[id].top = top;
```

When liquidators want to buy some of the collateral they call the Take() function. Inside take, the price the liquidator gets is given by the status function. This function passes the start price and elapsed time to the calc contract (AbacusLike) that applies a time-dependant price reduction to the price. Currently there are two implementations for the price reduction: linear price drop to zero over a given timeframe (linearDecrease), or an exponential drop every given number of seconds (StairstepExponentialDecrease).
```solidity
function status(uint96 tic, uint256 top) internal view returns (bool done, uint256 price) {
    price = calc.price(top, block.timestamp - tic);
    done  = (block.timestamp - tic > tail || rdiv(price, top) < cusp);
}
```  

The core of the issue is that the price calculation in Take() doesn't account for market price changes since the auction started. For a Take() call at time `t` it uses the formula  
$Price_t = buf * OraclePriceAtAuctionStart * dutchAuctionDropRatio$  
instead of  
$Price_t = buf * OraclePriceAtTime_t * dutchAuctionDropRatio$

For a liquidator, the profitability of a Take() is determined by   
$liquidatorProfit = (marketPrice-acutionPrice) * mkrAmount$  
Therefore for them the auction price changes only matter in relation to the market price. 

### Numeric example
#### Starting state
1. Mkr price: 2300 Dai 
2. Clipper buf: 1.1 (10%)
3. Clipper calc formula: 0.03% linear price drop per second.

#### Scenario 1 - market price goes down
1. An auction starts with price 2300 * 1.1 = 2530 Dai/Mkr. Liquidator profit  for 1Mkr: (2300-2530) * 1 = -230 
2. During the first 1000 secs the Mkr market price gradually drops 13% to 2001. 
3. A liquidator calls Take after 1000 seconds. Auction price = 2530 * (1-0.0003 * 1000) = 1771. market price = 2001. Liquidator profit for 1Mkr: (1771-2001) * 1 = -230 
4. Because of the market price change the liquidator is still not profitable inspite of the Dutch auction dropping the price by 30%. This increases the chance that the URN enters bad debt status.

#### Scenario 2 - market price goes up suddenly
1. An auction starts with price 2300 * 1.1 = 2530 Dai/Mkr. Liquidator profit  for 1Mkr: (2300-2530) * 1 = - 230 
2. During the first 24 secs (2 blocks) the Mkr market price rises sharply by 10% to 2530. 
3. A liquidator calls Take after 24 seconds. Auction price = 2530 * (1-0.0003 * 24) = 2512. market price = 2530. Liquidator profit for 1Mkr: (2530-2512) * 1 = 18
4. Because of the market price change, liquidation profitability rises much faster than the Dutch auction intended, causing loss for the URN owner through having their collateral sold for a worse (higher) price than they could have obtained with a real Dutch auction.

### Likelihood
Since liquidations typically happen in times of high price volatility, the likelihood of sharp price movements during an auction is high, increasing the risk of distorted Dutch auction pricing (see impact below)

### Root Cause
Using a stale Mkr oracle price when calculating a take() price, instead of fetching an updated price.

## Impact
1. In scenario 1 - loss to Vat users in the form of bad debt (accumulated over time can reach 5% of assets or more)
2. In scenario 2 - loss to liquidated URN owners. In times of high price volatility, the price for which the URN collateral is sold can easily be lower by 10% or more compared to the attainable price with accurate Dutch auction pricing, causing a loss of over 10% to the liquidated party.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Inside the Take function, apply buf to the **current** oracle price and pass that to the calc.price funcion instead of using the `top` value from the auction start:  
$Price_t = buf * OraclePriceAtTime_t * dutchAuctionDropRatio$
