# Attacker can prevent the liquidation of their loan using address collision in `LockstakeEngine`

### Summary

Using `create2` in [`LockstakeEngine.sol:242`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-makerdao-endgame/blob/main/lockstake/src/LockstakeEngine.sol#L242) allows attackers to prevent their collateral from being liquidated through address collision.

### Root Cause

In [`LockstakeEngine.sol:242`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-makerdao-endgame/blob/main/lockstake/src/LockstakeEngine.sol#L242), the `open` function uses `create2` to deploy the `urn` for the user. This function uses `msg.sender` and `index` to generate a `salt`, which is then used in `create2` to deploy the `urn`.
After a user opens a position and deploys an `urn`, they can call `lock` and deposit their collateral. The `lock` function will then mint `lsmkr` to the user's urn:
```solidity
        lsmkr.mint(urn, wad);
```
In the case of a liquidation, the `clipper` will call [`LockstakeEngine.sol:428`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-makerdao-endgame/blob/main/lockstake/src/LockstakeEngine.sol#L428), which will burn the `lsmkr` from the user's `urn`.

Given that the `open` function uses `create2` to deploy the `urn`, an attacker who can find an address collision will be able to deploy a malicious contract at the address that will collide with the `urn`. The attacker can approve infinite amount of `lsmkr` to themselves using this malicious contract and then `selfdestruct` it. They can then call `open` with the specific `msg.sender` and `index` that will result in a collision with the address of the malicious contract. After calling `lock`, the attacker can transfer the `lsmkr` to another address and `draw` a loan. In this situation, if the `clipper` calls `onKick`, the transaction will revert [in this line](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-makerdao-endgame/blob/main/lockstake/src/LockstakeEngine.sol#L428) because the `urn` has no `lsmkr` in balance. The attacker will be able to `draw` a loan and prevent the `clipper` from liquidating the collateral while simultaneously yielding in `StakingRewards.sol` with their `lsmkr`. This will result in bad debt for the protocol since the loan cannot be liquidated, and since the protocol cannot blacklist the `urn`, the attacker can repeat this many times.

### Internal pre-conditions

There are no internal preconditions.

### External pre-conditions

There are no external preconditions.

### Attack Path

The address collisions an attacker will need to find are:

1. One undeployed urn address.
2. An arbitrary attacker-controlled contract.

Both sets of addresses can be brute-force searched:
- The attacker deploys a `deployer` contract that can deploy many malicious contracts using `create2`.
- The attacker precomputes all the `create2` calls from the `deployer` contract and stores all the `2^80` addresses plus the `salt` that resulted in these addresses in a Bloom filter data structure.
- The attacker runs a brute-force on the `open` function with all those `2^80` malicious contract addresses as `msg.sender` and `0` as `index`, storing both the `msg.sender` and the `urn` address in a Bloom filter data structure.

Attacker finds a collision in the list (two same addresses). The attacker will then use the deployer contract with that specific `salt` that will result in address `0xCollide` and deploy the malicious contract. This malicious contract approves an infinite amount of `lsmkr` to the attacker's address and `selfdestruct` itself in the constructor.
Then, the attacker uses the second address (the `msg.sender` that would result in an `urn` with `0xCollide` as the address) and calls `open`. The collision happens, and the attacker can now transfer the `lsmkr` to any other addresses.

The feasibility, as well as the detailed technique and hardware requirements of finding a collision, are sufficiently described in multiple references:

- Two past issues on Sherlock describing this attack:
    1. [0x52's report](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-kyber-swap-judging/issues/90)
    2. [PUSH0's report](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia-judging/issues/59)
- [EIP-3607, which addresses this exact attack](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3607).
- [A blog post discussing the cost (money and time) of this exact attack](https://mystenlabs.com/blog/ambush-attacks-on-160bit-objectids-addresses).

Although this would require a large amount of compute it is already possible to break with current computing. **In less than a decade this would likely be a fairly easily attained amount of compute, nearly guaranteeing this attack.**

### Impact

The protocol suffers a bad debt because the attacker can interact with the lockstake, draw a loan, and prevent the protocol from liquidating the collateral.

### PoC

While I cannot provide an actual hash collision due to infrastructural constraints, it's possible to provide a coded PoC to prove the following two properties of the EVM that would enable this attack:

- A contract can be deployed on top of an address that already had a contract before.
- By deploying a contract and self-destruct in the same tx, we are able to set allowance for an address that has no bytecode.

Make a file named `PoC.t.sol` and paste the following code in it:
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

contract Token {
    mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) public allowance;

    function increaseAllowance(address to, uint256 amount) public {
       allowance[msg.sender][to] += amount;
    }
}

contract InstantApprove {
    function setApprove(Token ts, uint256 amount) public {
        ts.increaseAllowance(msg.sender, amount);
    }

    function destroy() public {
        selfdestruct(payable(tx.origin));
    }
}

contract Test {
    Token public ts;
    uint256 public constant APPROVE_AMOUNT = 2e18;

    constructor() {
        ts = new Token();
    }

    function test_Collide(uint _salt) public returns (address) {
        InstantApprove ia = new InstantApprove{salt: keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_salt))}();
        address ia_addr = address(ia);

        ia.setApprove(ts, APPROVE_AMOUNT);
        ia.destroy();
        return ia_addr;
    }

    function getCodeSize(address addr) public view returns (uint) {
        uint size;
        assembly {
            size := extcodesize(addr)
        }
        return size;
    }

    function getAllowance(address from) public view returns (uint) {
        return ts.allowance(from, address(this));
    } 
}
```
Run the test:
```bash
forge test --mt test_Collide
```

### Mitigation

The mitigation method is to prevent controlling over the deployed account address (or at least severely limit that). Some techniques may be:

- Do not use the user address as a determining factor for the `salt`.
- Use the vanilla contract creation with `create`, as opposed to `create2`
