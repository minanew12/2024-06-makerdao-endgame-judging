# Improper Input Validation in the exec Function

## Summary
The `exec` function in the `FlapperUniV2` contract lacks input validation for the `lot` parameter. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential losses if a user provides an unreasonable or extreme lot size.

## Vulnerability Detail
The exec function accepts a lot parameter, which represents the desired amount of liquidity tokens to mint. There are no checks to ensure that this value is within reasonable bounds. A user could potentially pass a very large or very small value for lot, which could have the following consequences:
- Large lot size: If the lot size is excessively large, it could result in a very large trade that may not be feasible given the available liquidity in the DEX. This could lead to high slippage or even failure of the transaction.
- Small lot size: An extremely small lot size might not be worth the gas costs associated with the transaction, making it economically inefficient.

## Impact
The lack of input validation in the exec function opens up the possibility of unintended trades being executed. This could result in financial losses due to high slippage or inefficient use of gas.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-makerdao-endgame/blob/main/dss-flappers/src/FlapperUniV2.sol#L141-L164

```solidity
function exec(uint256 lot) external auth {
        // Check Amounts
        (uint256 _reserveDai, uint256 _reserveGem) = _getReserves();

        uint256 _sell = _getDaiToSell(lot, _reserveDai);

        uint256 _buy = _getAmountOut(_sell, _reserveDai, _reserveGem);
        require(_buy >= _sell * want / (uint256(pip.read()) * RAY / spotter.par()), "FlapperUniV2/insufficient-buy-amount");
        //

        // Swap
        GemLike(dai).transfer(address(pair), _sell);
        (uint256 _amt0Out, uint256 _amt1Out) = daiFirst ? (uint256(0), _buy) : (_buy, uint256(0));
        pair.swap(_amt0Out, _amt1Out, address(this), new bytes(0));
        //

        // Deposit
        GemLike(dai).transfer(address(pair), lot - _sell);
        GemLike(gem).transfer(address(pair), _buy);
        uint256 _liquidity = pair.mint(receiver);
        //

        emit Exec(lot, _sell, _buy, _liquidity);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
add input validation to the `exec` function

```solidity
function exec(uint256 lot, uint256 maxSlippage) external auth {
    require(lot >= MIN_LOT_SIZE, "FlapperUniV2/lot-too-small");
    require(lot <= MAX_LOT_SIZE, "FlapperUniV2/lot-too-large");

    // ... (rest of the function logic)
}
```
