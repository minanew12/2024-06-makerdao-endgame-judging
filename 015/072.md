# There is not enough incentive to call `VoteDelegate.reserveHatch` as it can be abused by attackers to drain gas fees from liquidators

### Summary

`LockstakeEngine` liquidation of unhealthy accounts can be blocked by the attacker if he calls `VoteDelegate.lock` for the unhealthy vault every block as liquidation in the same block then reverts when trying to `VoteDelegate.free` (`Chief` flashloan protection). Liquidator can then call `VoteDelegate.reserveHatch`, which will disable `VoteDelegate.lock` function for 5 blocks, allowing liquidator to liquidate the vault.

The issue is that this 2-step liquidation (liquidator has to call `VoteDelegate.reserveHatch` first, only then he can call `Dog.bark` within the next 5 blocks) requires 2 transactions in separate blocks and liquidator is only paid for the `Dog.bark`, but not for the `reserveHatch`. This means there is lack of incentive for the liquidator to call this function. This can become especially bad if the attacker intentionally forces liquidators to call `reserveHatch` (by intentionally creating unhealthy vaults with `VoteDelegate.lock` call every block), and then immediately repaying the debt to make the vault healthy again as soon as `reserveHatch` is called by anyone. Due to the 2-blocks requirement for the liquidator in such case, attacker can always avoid liquidation and liquidator can never liquidate, but is forced to call `reserveHatch` all the time, losing gas fees.

Moreover, attacker can use the `reserveHatch` call as an indication of pending liquidation: so the attacker intentionally keeps unhealthy vault and if liquidators stop calling unprofitable `reserveHatch`, attacker simply keeps vault unhealthy further until it goes into bad debt to cause loss of funds for the protocol. But if liquidator does try to `reserveHatch`, attacker immediately repays the debt to make it healthy again and waste liquidator's gas.

### Root Cause

`VoteDelegate.reserveHatch` functionaltiy is cumbersome and creates a 2-steps liquidation process in 2 blocks:

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Attacker's vault has some `VoteDelegate` selected
2. Attacker puts his vault at the edge of being unhealthy (maxes out the debt)
3. Next block the vault becomes unhealthy
4. Attacker calls `VoteDelegate.lock` every block to prevent liquidation in the same block
5. Liquidator, being unable to liquidate user's vault (due to revert when trying to `VoteDelegate.free` in the liquidation), calls `VoteDelegate.reserveHatch`
6. Attacker immediately repays the tiny debt to make the account healthy again and repeats from 4.
7. If liquidator doesn't call `reserveHatch`, attacker simply waits until the vault goes into bad debt to cause funds loss to the protocol

### Impact

1. Liquidators are forced to call `VoteDelegate.reserveHatch` many times without actual liquidation happening, thus wasting gas fees. 
2. When done frequently, liquidators might be disincentivized from calling `reserveHatch` at all and liquidating such user, exposing the protocol to uncontained losses from such attacker (easily 5%+ damage with large vault)

### PoC

Not needed

### Mitigation

Re-design the `reserveHatch` functionality which is very inconvenient for all parties and creates security issues as well.
