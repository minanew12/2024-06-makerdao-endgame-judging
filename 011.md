# Incorrect way of checking for overflow opened totalsupply to overflow breaking the invariant

## Summary
The mint function in the provided Solidity code lacks proper overflow checks, which can lead to critical issues in the smart contract. 
It was noted that the was check for overflow, yes there was but for ```balanceOf[to] = balanceOf[to] + value;``` but not for ```totalSupply = totalSupply + value;```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-makerdao-endgame/blob/main/endgame-toolkit/src/SDAO.sol#L278
## Vulnerability Detail
The totalSupply is incremented directly without any overflow protection. If the value is sufficiently large, the addition can cause an overflow, resulting in an incorrect and misleading totalSupply
```solidity
 function mint(address to, uint256 value) external auth {
        require(to != address(0) && to != address(this), "SDAO/invalid-address");
        unchecked {
            // Note: safe as the sum of all balances is equal to `totalSupply`;
            // there is already an overvlow check below
            balanceOf[to] = balanceOf[to] + value;
        }
        totalSupply = totalSupply + value;

        emit Transfer(address(0), to, value);
    }
```
The assumption is that at any given time, the sum of the balances of all accounts should exactly match the `totalSupply.`
The mint function is responsible for creating new tokens and adding them to a specific account (to). When minting new tokens, the `totalSupply` is increased by the amount minted.
The comment suggests that since the function directly increases both the `balanceOf[to]` and the `totalSupply` by the same amount, and assuming there are no other bugs or vulnerabilities, the sum of all balances should still match the totalSupply after the operation.

Let's break down a simple example to understand the significance of this invariant:

`totalSupply =` 1000
`balanceOf[Alice] =` 500
`balanceOf[Bob] =` 500

The sum of all balances `(balanceOf[Alice] + balanceOf[Bob])` is 1000, which matches totalSupply as said in the inline [comment:](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-makerdao-endgame/blob/main/endgame-toolkit/src/SDAO.sol#L281C9-L282C56)
```solidity
            // Note: safe as the sum of all balances is equal to `totalSupply`;
            // there is already an overvlow check below
```
The contract `mints` 100 new tokens to Charlie.
`totalSupply` is increased by 100
`balanceOf[Charlie]` is increased by 100
> Post mint

`totalSupply` = 1100
`balanceOf[Alice]` = 500
`balanceOf[Bob]` = 500
`balanceOf[Charlie]` = 100

The sum of all balances `(balanceOf[Alice] + balanceOf[Bob] + balanceOf[Charlie])` is now 1100, which matches the new totalSupply.

But all that happened will not happen because it's an assumption. Total supply was never checked for overflow, which we can see in the mint function and is highly likely to happen.

>Now

`totalSupply` = 2^256 - 10 (very close to the maximum uint256 value)

`balanceOf[Alice]` = 500
`balanceOf[Bob]` = 500
`balanceOf[Charlie]` = 0
The sum of all balances is `balanceOf[Alice] + balanceOf[Bob] + balanceOf[Charlie]` = 500 + 500 + 0 = 1000, and `totalSupply` is 2^256 - 10.

An `auth` calls the mint function to mint 20 new tokens to Charlie
`totalSupply` becomes 2^256 - 10 + 20, which causes an overflow. Since 2^256 is the maximum value for a uint256, adding any number greater than 2^256 - `totalSupply` causes the value to wrap around.

`totalSupply` = 10 (due to overflow)
`balanceOf[Alice]` = 500
`balanceOf[Bob]` = 500
`balanceOf[Charlie]` = 20

the sum of all balances is balanceOf[Alice] + balanceOf[Bob] + balanceOf[Charlie] = 500 + 500 + 20 = 1020, but totalSupply is 10. This breaks the invariant that the sum of all balances should equal totalSupply.

## Impact
Break the assumption that it can't overflow.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
 function mint(address to, uint256 value) external auth {
        require(to != address(0) && to != address(this), "SDAO/invalid-address");
        unchecked {
            // Note: safe as the sum of all balances is equal to `totalSupply`;
            // there is already an overvlow check below
            balanceOf[to] = balanceOf[to] + value;
        }
        totalSupply = totalSupply + value;

        emit Transfer(address(0), to, value);
    }
```
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
```solidity
function mint(address to, uint256 value) external auth {
    require(to != address(0) && to != address(this), "SDAO/invalid-address");
    
    // SafeMath-like checks for overflow
    uint256 newBalance = balanceOf[to] + value;
    require(newBalance >= balanceOf[to], "SDAO/balance-overflow");
    balanceOf[to] = newBalance;

    uint256 newTotalSupply = totalSupply + value;
    require(newTotalSupply >= totalSupply, "SDAO/totalSupply-overflow");
    totalSupply = newTotalSupply;

    emit Transfer(address(0), to, value);
}
```
