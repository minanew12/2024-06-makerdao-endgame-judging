# Permissionless distribute() function can extend the period finish time

## Summary
Anyone could extend the reward finish time by calling permissionless `distribute()` function from `VestedRewardsDistribution.sol`, potentially resulting in users receiving fewer rewards than expected within the same time period.
## Vulnerability Detail
The only requirement for calling this function is if the amount is greater than 0:
```solidity
function distribute() external returns (uint256 amount) {
        require(vestId != INVALID_VEST_ID, "VestedRewardsDistribution/invalid-vest-id");

        amount = dssVest.unpaid(vestId);
>>>     require(amount > 0, "VestedRewardsDistribution/no-pending-amount");

        lastDistributedAt = block.timestamp;
        dssVest.vest(vestId, amount);

        require(gem.transfer(address(stakingRewards), amount), "VestedRewardsDistribution/transfer-failed");
>>>     stakingRewards.notifyRewardAmount(amount);

        emit Distribute(amount);
    }
```
```solidity
function notifyRewardAmount(uint256 reward) external override onlyRewardsDistribution updateReward(address(0)) {
        if (block.timestamp >= periodFinish) {
            rewardRate = reward / rewardsDuration;
        } else {
            uint256 remaining = periodFinish - block.timestamp;
            uint256 leftover = remaining * rewardRate;
            rewardRate = (reward + leftover) / rewardsDuration;
        }

        uint256 balance = rewardsToken.balanceOf(address(this));
        require(rewardRate <= balance / rewardsDuration, "Provided reward too high");

        lastUpdateTime = block.timestamp;
>>>     periodFinish = block.timestamp + rewardsDuration;
        emit RewardAdded(reward);
    }
```
Variable `amount` is calculated based on timestamp and some other variables:
```solidity
 /**
        @dev amount of tokens accrued, not accounting for tokens paid
        @param _time The timestamp to perform the calculation
        @param _bgn  The start time of the contract
        @param _clf  The timestamp of the cliff
        @param _fin  The end time of the contract
        @param _tot  The total amount of the contract
        @param _rxd  The number of gems received
        @return amt  The claimable amount
    */
    function unpaid(uint256 _time, uint48 _bgn, uint48 _clf, uint48 _fin, uint128 _tot, uint128 _rxd) internal pure returns (uint256 amt) {
        amt = _time < _clf ? 0 : sub(accrued(_time, _bgn, _fin, _tot), _rxd);
    }
```
It is possible for a malicious user to calculate when this function will return very small values, making the attack almost cost-free. Calling this function will break calculations: extend the period finish time and decrease reward rate. 
This could result in loss of rewards: if there are 10 DAI rewards within a 10-day period, a malicious user could extend the finish time on day 5, extending the finish time to the 15th day. Participants would only receive 7.5 DAI by the 10th day.
## Impact
Anyonce could extend the reward finish time and the users may receive less rewards than expected during the same time period.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make the function permissioned:
```diff
-   function distribute() external returns (uint256 amount)
+   function distribute() external returns (uint256 amount) auth
```
