# Insufficient Input Validation in the kick and take Functions of LockstakeClipper Contract

## Summary
The `kick` and `take` functions in the `LockstakeClipper` contract have some input validation, but it could be more robust. Specifically, there's a lack of checks to ensure that the tab (`debt`) is greater than a minimum value. This could lead to economically inefficient liquidations.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `kick` function, the tab parameter represents the outstanding debt of a CDP that is being liquidated. Currently, the contract only checks that the tab is not zero. However, it doesn't enforce a minimum threshold for the tab amount. This means that even very small debts could trigger a liquidation process, which might not be economically justifiable due to the gas costs associated with the auction.

Similarly, in the `take` function, where users can purchase collateral from the auction, there's no check to ensure that the remaining tab after a partial purchase is above a minimum threshold. This could result in leftover auctions with very small remaining debts that might never be cleared, as keepers may not find it profitable to participate in such auctions due to the high gas costs relative to the potential reward.

## Impact
Economic Inefficiency: Liquidations could be triggered for CDPs with very small debts, resulting in unnecessary gas costs for both the system and the users involved.
Stale Auctions: Partial purchases could leave behind auctions with very small remaining debts, making them unattractive to keepers and potentially clogging up the system with uncleared auctions.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
add minimum debt checks in both the kick and take functions. This can be done by introducing a constant or a configurable variable to define the minimum allowed debt.

For the kick function:

```Solidity
require(tab >= MIN_DEBT, "LockstakeClipper/tab-too-small");
```

For the take function:

```Solidity
// ... (inside the take function)
uint256 remainingTab = tab - owe;
require(remainingTab == 0 || remainingTab >= MIN_DEBT, "LockstakeClipper
```
