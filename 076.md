# The function `take` will cause the user to buy collateral exceeding the `max` price.

### Summary

The variable `slice` recalculation in the take function will cause the price of the collateral to increase, which may exceed the `max` price and cause losses to users.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-makerdao-endgame/blob/main/lockstake/src/LockstakeClipper.sol#L332-L373
In LockstakeClipper.sol:373, the variable `slice` is recalculated and will be smaller than before, therefore, prices will rise accordingly which may exceed the `max` price. However, there is no check, which causes losses to users.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. auth user calls function `kick` function to start a auction


### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. victim calls the function `take`.

### Impact

Users will be affected by fund losses, and their losses may exceed 1%.
For exampe, when the tab = 1000, price = 11, lot = 100, and user call the function `take` will amt = 100 and max =11 (which means he/she want to buy all the collateral ). Then, the owe = 1100, which exceeds the tab. Next, the slice will be recalculated to be 90(1000/11). However, the real price will become 11.11 (1000/90) at the same time, which exceeds the `max` price and the lose is 1%(0.11/11).

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a price check after the slice recalculation.
