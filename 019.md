## Summary

title: `VoteDelegate` Contract Governance Roles

1. methods in the `VoteDelegate` contract are allow the delegate to execute votes on governance decisions without the emitting events or using time-lock mechanisms.

## Vulnerability Detail

1. the `vote` methods (`vote(address[] memory yays)` and `vote(bytes32 slate)`) and `votePoll` methods (`votePoll(uint256 pollId, uint256 optionId)` and `votePoll(uint256[] calldata pollIds, uint256[] calldata optionIds)`) have enable the delegate to making the impactful decisions for the protocol governance without transparency
2. if this methods lack a two-step process with a mandatory time window, allowing immediate execution of actions which can lead to governance manipulation or misuse without perhaps prior notice

## Impact

1. highly impact and medium likeliness
2. absence of event emissions and time-lock mechanisms lead to untraceable governance changes and potential misuse for a delegate authority

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

1. the time-lock mechanism for the sensitive functions
2. the two-step process with the mandatory delay for the impact changes
